{"document": "# 3 Gate Robo\n## Execution\n### Adaptation\n\nA common response to Colossi is to produce dedicated anti-air units (Phoenix, Viking, Corruptor) to directly attack one's Colossi. Continuing to produce Colossi for the long term is not advised, as losing these units is costly and also robs one's forces of valuable damage against massed units. At such a point one should already have a Twilight Council for the purpose of getting Charge or Blink, so the next logical progression is to build a Templar Archives and produce High Templar. Short term Colossi may be necessary to buy time for Storm to complete, but make sure that further gas goes to Templar production. This both erases the effectiveness of the anti-air units while maintaining a strong army capable of area damage via Storm.\n\nShould the dedicated anti-air not come, another transition along the same lines is to build a Dark Shrine and add Dark Templar to one's main army in small numbers. These units will do further damage while undetected by one's opponent. They are faster than High Templar and can move with the army, and will add to one's damage output greatly. They are also excellent for map control in the mid-late game.\n\nMassed air-to-ground units (Void Rays/Mutalisks/Banshees) require switching out of this tech in favor of Blink Stalkers and more Gateways. Immortals/Observers can be produced if the Robotics Facility is idle.\n\nFacing Siege Tanks requires Immortals instead of Colossi.", "question": "When facing a large number of anti-air units, what is a recommended strategy to maintain a strong army capable of area damage?", "options": ["Build more Colossi", "Produce dedicated anti-air units", "Construct a Templar Archives and produce High Templar", "Upgrade to Siege Tanks"], "answer": "Construct a Templar Archives and produce High Templar"}

{"document": "# Spine Crawler Rush (vs. Protoss)\n\nSpine Crawler Rush\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:ZvP\nType:Rush, Tech\nPopularized by:Nes\nTea, Idr\nA\n\n## Overview\n\nA one base Spine Crawler/Lair rush for punishing the opponent's early expand, e.g. Forge FE. Once Lair is complete Overlords are able to generate creep to place Spine Crawlers within striking distance of the opponent's wall-off.\n\nThis build is essentially an all-in as the Zerg's economy does suffer due to getting a late 1st Queen, and if little or no damage is done and the Zerg went with an expansion-less opening he is miles behind the Protoss economically. You may wish to follow-up with an all-in involving any of the following: Zergling, Baneling, Roach or Hydralisk depending on if the opponent has opened Stargate or not; or continue the game as normal.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\nYou can open with an Economic Pool First or Hatchery First, either one will work.  If you open pool first, get gas immediately after making your Spawning Pool.  If you open Hatchery First, get gas before making your Spawning Pool.\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| @ 100% Spawning Pool, Queen; @ 100 , Lair; @ 100 , Zergling Speed, take Drones off of gas; @ 100% Lair, 3 Spine Crawlers outside opponent's natural |\n|  |\n\n- @ 100% Spawning Pool, Queen\n\n- @ 100 , Lair\n\n- @ 100 , Zergling Speed, take Drones off of gas\n\n- @ 100% Lair, 3 Spine Crawlers outside opponent's natural\n\n### Notes\n\nSince you get a very fast Lair, you will only have 1 Queen.\n\nMake sure you have 2 Overlords in position and 300 Minerals: outside of your opponent's base when the Lair finishes.  Move your 3 Drones when Lair is about 75% complete.\n\nAs soon as Lair completes, start generating creep with your Overlords and place your Spine Crawlers as soon as possible.\n\n### Scouting\n\nThis build should only be used against a Forge Fast Expand opening, so make sure you scout this opening before using this build.  Otherwise, you need to watch for scouting Probes and kill them before they see a fast Lair.\n\n## Execution\n\nPlace the Spine Crawlers a bit outside of the vision of the Protoss base, that way your opponent cannot immediately see that you are building Spine Crawlers unless he scouts with a Probe or other unit.  As soon as you kill the Forge or Gateway, try to run in with your Zerglings.  Move your Spine Crawlers forward once you destroy the wall.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nSince this is an all-in, there is little room for adaptation provided your Protoss opponent is able to hold without sustaining too much damage.  If there is a second entrance via rocks (such as on Terminus SE), you can begin destroying it while your Spine Crawlers complete or while you're attacking.  Otherwise, you are looking to end the game with your Zerglings as soon as you break the wall with your Spine Crawlers.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\nSince this relies on Protoss using a Forge Fast Expand opening, this works best on maps that favor such openings, however it will work on any map. The Zerg's goals with the rush can also affect good/bad map features, for instance if you simply want to attempt to snipe a Nexus, maps with wide open naturals such as Dual Sight and Xel Naga Caverns are preferable, whereas if you are backing up the rush with many Zerglings a map where a wall (and therefore the cannons it includes) is placed in a choke \"ahead\" of the expanding Protoss Nexus may be preferable, such as on Terminus RE.\n\n### Con features\n\nAny map that does not favor a Forge Fast Expand opening will also not favor this build.  However if Protoss still does a Forge Fast Expand opening on a map that does not favor it, you can still use this build.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of placing Spine Crawlers outside the opponent's natural in the Spine Crawler Rush strategy?", "options": ["To provide an early warning system", "To disrupt the opponent's early expansion", "To secure a resource-rich area", "To create a defensive perimeter around your base"], "answer": "To disrupt the opponent's early expansion"}
{"document": "# Hydralisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nDue to the Roach-focused nature of ZvZ, Hydralisks represent a significant power spike that, when scouted, often requires a response of either extreme aggression or building one's own tech.\n\nHydras are frequently added to a Roach army to form a Roach/Hydra style when there has been early aggression and neither player has maxed-out or gotten close to maximum supply with Roach/Ravager. Adding even a handful of Hydras to an army that is already nearly maxed makes a noticeable difference in DPS once each army has spread out, as Hydras even without Grooved Spines for range can safely fire from behind the Roach line. Hydras also give the player building them access to anti-air, allowing them to clear out Overlords and Overseers which will likely be all throughout the map. Some players may add a few Hydras earlier for this purpose to either supply block their opponent or to remove map vision.\n\nBecause Hydralisks make a smaller benefit when added to a large Roach/Ravager ball without their upgrades and are more fragile, players may start a Lurker Den and Hydra upgrades as soon as the Hydra Den finishes and only make a small group of Hydras a little over halfway through the Lurker Den's build time. This gives the player immediate access to Lurkers once they hatch. This is a common choice for a player who is behind and looking to defend without adequate defense. While the Hydra upgrades research, such a player may be more aggressive and try to get the jump on their opponent with the added splash damage of the Lurkers. Ravagers' Corrosive Bile out-ranges an unupgraded Lurker, so special care must be taken maneuvering them. Ideally, after taking cost effective fights, such a player will re-max with a decent number of Hydras alongside their Roaches and Ravagers, their Hydra upgrades nearly complete.\n\nIn the late game, the ultimate unit composition is Hydra/Viper/Lurker, but because these units are so expensive in terms of vespene gas and are fairly fragile, Roaches will often see continued use alongside them. Ravagers' Corrosive Bile out-ranges an unupgraded Lurker and may be used safely before they have the range upgrade, Seismic Spines, especially before a player has Vipers for Blinding Cloud/Abduct to properly engage them. Ravagers will have a smaller place in the late game as they are so expensive in gas and are out DPS'd by the equal range, less expensive Hydra(upgraded), but their ability is a still a strong zoning tool. A high Hydra count allows for massive DPS and gives the player a chance to jockey for positioning against their opponent's Vipers. Against Lurkers, Hydras and Roaches have similar vitality due to the Lurker's 50% bonus damage to armored units.\n\nIf facing a player using the Mutalisk/Zergling/Baneling style, Hydralisks are an important step in a successful defense, but should not be used as a direct answer to the Mutas. Although more cost effective in even numbers at a small count, eventually the Mutas' mobility will allow them to make cost effective hit-and-runs, as well as be able to stack in such great numbers that they have far more units attacking at once and quickly retreat for a fast, full heal. Infestors for Fungal Growth and a high Queen count (10+) are much more effective at zoning out or potentially catching many of the Mutas. Vipers also are important for landing dangerous Parasitic Bombs, and should be supported by high damage anti-air like Hydras to keep the Viper alive afterwards; Queens' damage is more long-form and might not be enough to stop the Mutas diving on the Viper if it is in an undefended position. Scouting an opponent's Hydra Den may indicate an eventual Lurker transition as opposed to trying to end the game with Ultralisks.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the primary role of Hydralisks when added to a Roach army in ZvZ matchups?", "options": ["To provide additional ground mobility", "To enhance the army's anti-air capabilities", "To increase the army's supply limit", "To reduce the cost of Roaches"], "answer": "To enhance the army's anti-air capabilities"}

{"document": "# Partin\n## Overview\n### Goal\n\nThe goal of this style is to gain map control before a Terran can push out on the map in order to secure a faster third base than most other builds. The combination of early game pressure, light harassment capabilities and fairly quick Colossus tech allow the Protoss to play more aggressively around 12:00-13:00 instead of being stuck in their base worrying about defending drops or SCV pulls. This second round of aggression in turn can either turn into a powerful all-in or simply secure a Psionic Storm transition heading to the late game.\n\nAll these factors make this style quite deceiving to play against: the presence of Blink Stalkers early on is enough to scare most Terran players into being overly defensive, while the mid game Colossus attacks hit at awkward timings that easily catch any opponent off guard and out of position. Additionally, the basic opening is extremely versatile, allowing for several different builds to mix things up and play very unpredictably.\n\nOf course, not every build is perfect, and for every advantage gained there is also a drawback. Investing in early game Stalker and a quick third naturally delays your upgrades, but more importantly, delays the Robo for a minute and makes it impossible to afford an extensive Observer network.

{"document": "# Cloak\n\nCloak\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):Ghost\nBanshee\nCost: 0 / DDuration:Until deactivation or energy depletion (Ghost)\nResearched from:Ghost Academy, [[Tech Lab|Tech Lab]]Research \n\nCloak is a defensive spell used by the Terran Ghost and Banshee which renders a unit invisible. The Spectre in the Campaign is also able to cloak, though it is not available in Multiplayer. Similar to a burrowed Zerg unit, a cloaked unit can be distinguished by keen players without detection by a distorted, graphical reflection.\n\nA cloaked unit can only be targeted by an enemy player with a detector. However, a cloaked unit can still be hit by EMP Round, Psionic Storm, Fungal Growth or a manually detonated Baneling. A cloaked unit that has been hit by Fungal Growth will be revealed for the 4 seconds of the Fungal Growth and can be targeted by all nearby units.\n\nWhile cloaked the unit can still move, attack, patrol, and in the Ghost's case, cast EMP Round, Snipe and call down Tactical Nukes. However, during Cloak energy is consumed at a rate of 0.9 energy per tick and Cloak is disabled when the unit's energy depletes.\n\n## Use\n\nCloak is used on Ghosts and Banshees to hide them from normal vision where only detecting units can see them. Either unit, when combined with Cloak, is capable of performing extraordinary harassment. With Ghosts, Cloak is typically used while calling down nuclear strikes. Banshees can use Cloak while harassing with great results. Often Cloak will grant the players Banshee harassment a new life, as the research timing completes in the middle of the harass.\n\nThis gives the Banshee user extra incentive to prevent Sensors like Photon Cannons and Missile Turrets from building, and the Banshee user may target these during their initial harassment. Using cloaked Banshees against un-prepared opponents can end games very quickly by dealing massive economic damage.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nCloak can be used on Ghosts at key moments where the Ghosts are vulnerable to High Templar's Feedback, preventing them from being targeted. This will succeed if the opponent does not have an Observer to detect the Ghosts within range. This gives the player the advantage of being able to use EMP on the opponents forces freely.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nCloak magnifies the usefulness of the ghost and banshee in TvT, especially when used against a Terran mech army. A Ghost's Cloak in combination with a Tactical Nuke exploits the lack of mobility of a tank-heavy army. Cloak forces the Terran opponent to either use a Scanner Sweep or reposition, opening a timing window for a counter-attack by the harassing player. Cloaked Banshees have a similar effect for their strength against an immobile mech army. Cloaked Banshees force the opposing Terran to use Scanner Sweeps or Missile Turrets in combination with anti-air in order to prevent harassment.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nSince Zerg is known for being a gas heavy race, they often have bare minimal detection from their Overseers. Because of this, Cloak can be quite effective to harass or in combination with abilities like Snipe or Tactical Nuke.\n\n## In Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm\n\nIn Wings of Liberty, the Banshee Cloaking Field upgrade cost 200 minerals and 200 gas.\n\nDue to the change of timing in Legacy of the Void, the timings are different in the last expansion than in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm. In the previous expansions, the personal cloak drained 0.9 energy per second after the initial 25 energy cost. The research took 120 seconds for the Ghost, and 110 seconds for the Banshee.\n\n## Notes", "question": "Which of the following units can be cloaked in StarCraft II and can still move, attack, and use abilities while cloaked?", "options": ["Zergling", "Marine", "Banshee", "Zealot"], "answer": "Banshee"}
{"document": "# Graviton Beam\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nThere are interesting effects associated with a group of Phoenixes casting multiple graviton beams on enemy units and attempting to kill them. Too many graviton beams cast will have too many Phoenixes channelling the spell, and drop the Phoenixes overall damage output to where units don't die in a timely manner. Too few cast will result in overkill and some Phoenixes sitting idle. Therefore in the interest of dealing maximum damage the player must find a balance between keeping all Phoenixes constantly firing, not over-killing, and minimizing units in the air at once. In order to find this perfect balance for maximum damage output, use the following formula to find out how many units to raise at once:\n[Number of Phoenixes] / (1 + [number of hits Phoenixes take to kill target unit]), rounded up = [number of units to be in the air at a given time]\n\nThis still does not completely avoid overkill due to incidental focus firing. This can be minimized by manually focus firing.\n\nOn the other hand, in many circumstances it is favourable to suspend as many units as possible in the air to prevent them from either escaping or dealing damage. This is particularly true when other friendly anti-air units such as Stalkers or Void Rays are present.\n\nUltimately the player should consider both priorities of dealing damage and disabling units in tandem when choosing how many units to elevate.", "question": "What is the primary reason for balancing the number of Phoenixes casting Graviton Beam on enemy units in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To ensure all Phoenixes are idle and not firing", "To maximize damage output while minimizing overkill", "To increase the number of enemy units escaping", "To decrease the effectiveness of friendly anti-air units"], "answer": "To maximize damage output while minimizing overkill"}
{"document": "# Infernal Pre-Igniter\n## Use\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, anything that the Hellion and Hellbat do well already will be significantly amplified by this bonus.\n\nThe worker units for all three races are categorized as light, as are first-tier infantry for all three races. This makes the Pre-Igniter a highly effective harassment tool, and a few Hellions with the upgrade can wreak havoc on vulnerable mineral lines. A superior player can abuse the Hellion's speed to get in and out of the mineral line very rapidly, inflicting as much damage as possible before darting away from the opponent's slower army. A Hellbat can 2-shot multiple workers at a time, since with the upgrade it deals 30 damage, doing devastating damage. However, since only two Hellbats can fit in a Medivac (as opposed to 4 Hellions), and transforming between the two takes 5 seconds, during which an enemy can react to the harassment), Hellbats have a much harder time getting in and out of mineral lines to do damage.\n\nBecause the AoE damage of a Hellion is in a straight line in front of the unit, it is most effective to have Hellions flank the opponents army if they are used in a large battle, because of the tendency for range units to create a concave or line against each other. An attack from the side by Hellions would maximize the amount of AoE damage that they could deal.", "question": "Why is it recommended to flank the opponent's army with Hellions during a large battle in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To avoid taking damage from the enemy's front-line units.", "Because Hellions have a higher attack speed when flanking.", "Because the AoE damage of a Hellion is in a straight line in front of the unit, maximizing damage output.", "To confuse the enemy's army formation."], "answer": "Because the AoE damage of a Hellion is in a straight line in front of the unit, maximizing damage output."}

If you can trap Terran units against the Zealots using Force Fields then the Zealots will make short work of them, especially if they're underneath a Guardian Shield. Force Fields can also be used to prevent the Terran from repairing Bunkers (or other structures), which will make it much easier to bust through their defences.\n\nIf you see 3 Bunkers or more, or 2 Bunkers that already have SCVs ready to repair them, then it means the Terran is on to you and that you'll have no chance of breaking them. You should either abandon your rush and take an expansion, spending as much Chrono Boost on Probes as possible in order to catch-up with the Terran, or try to run beyond the Bunkers if the Terran doesn't have a complete wall-off.

{"document": "# Widow Mine (Legacy of the Void)\n## Targeting Mechanism\n\n1) A widow mine takes about 1.07 seconds to activate.

The Robotics Facility can produce the Observer, Warp Prism, Immortal, and, after a Robotics Bay has been completed, the Colossus and the Disruptor.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Robotics Facility can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. It can only produce units while it remains within the Matrix, otherwise it becomes unpowered and cannot function.\n\n| Unit | Minerals: | Vespene Gas: | Supply: | Build Time: | Key |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Observer | 25 | 75 | 1 | 18 | B |\n| Warp Prism | 250 | 0 | 2 | 36 | A |\n| Immortal | 275 | 100 | 4 | 39 | I |\n| Colossus | 300 | 200 | 6 | 54 | C |\n| Disruptor | 150 | 150 | 3 | 36 | D |\n\n## Competitive Use\n\nAll of the units built from the Robo are excellent support units that won't make up the bulk of the Protoss army, but are crucial in a good midgame army composition.\n\nBecause it enables the production of the only mobile detector for the Protoss (the Observer), getting a Robotics Facility early is a priority in most matchups. Without mobile detection, Protoss armies are vulnerable to any cloaked or burrowed enemies. For that reason, most strategic options favor (or even require) a route through the Robotics Facility, even if the Observer is the only unit produced from this structure.\n\nThe Immortal is a unit used to support the early/mid-game Protoss army, they can be crucial for holding off early pushes and also make a great addition to heavy gateway unit based pushes to deal with large amounts of armoured units that normal gateway compositions may have trouble with, such as Roaches or Marauders and can also be used to break Bunker defences.\n\nThe Colossus, due to its ability to dominate the ground, is often at the center of strategic plans. Obtaining a significant number of Colossi quickly, sometimes on just one base, is a common goal of Protoss players. This means that many players build a Robotics Facility and Robotics Bay with very careful timing, as early as possible in the match.\n\nThe Disruptor, added in Legacy of the Void, is an alternative to the Colossus. Its Purification Nova ability provides more splash damage than the Colossus, but the unit requires more micro management. It works well against death balls, which will need micro management to avoid massive damage. The Purification Nova is also a way for Protoss to kill Lurkers without getting in range or their spines.", "question": "Which unit produced by the Robotics Facility is crucial for detecting cloaked or burrowed units, making it a priority in most matchups?", "options": ["Immortal", "Colossus", "Observer", "Disruptor"], "answer": "Observer"}

This is also indicated by the appearance of crystals on the backs of the Roaches.\n\nThe Roach is useful in all three match-ups because it can absorb large amounts of damage. Roaches have very high HP values considering their cheap cost. This is augmented by its ability to regenerate its health at a tremendous rate of 7 HP/second while Burrowed. This allows for a full heal in just over 20 seconds. However, due to both of its slow attack and slow speed while unupgraded, it performs poorly in the early game compared to other units, such as speed Zerglings or defensive Queens.\n\nNote that while the Roach also has a melee attack animation, it is affected by Range Attack upgrades, but not by a Guardian Shield.\n\n## Abilities\n\nRapid Regeneration\nWhile burrowed, the Roach regenerates its health at an extremely fast rate of 7 hit points per second.\n\nMorph to Ravager\nCaster: Roach Minerals: 25 75 1\nDuration: 12.14 s\nMorphs the Roach into a Ravager.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nGlial Reconstitution Minerals: 100 100 79\nResearched from: Roach Warren\nRequires: Lair\nIncreases Roach movement speed to 4.2 (+1.05) while unburrowed, and to 4.4 while burrowed under creep.\n\nTunneling Claws Minerals: 100 100 79\nResearched from: Roach Warren\nRequires: Lair\nGives Roaches the ability to move while burrowed at a speed of 2.8.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nRoaches are used to pin units in place, have a large amount of life, and are gas efficient.  Their ability to morph into Ravagers, which have a longer ranged attack, allows the Zerg players to morph only the units they need instead of having to make dedicated units like Hydras that are more gas expensive. Storms are not very effective against these units (as opposed to Zerglings).\n\n- The key unit to defend Glaive Adepts.\n\n- Dodging Disruptor shots could be hard, but with the help of creep this's much easier.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nRoach-Ravager compositions, with the Roach as the backbone, are serious threats to Terran in the early game. When used correctly in timing builds that combine +1 missile ,+1 armor and Roach Speed, this alone can often end the game right there before the 8-minute mark. Of course, the effectiveness of this unit depends on the player's skill and, in this case, macro. Large Roach-Ravager armies combined with other units to counter the Terran forces are still deadly and used by many in the late game, as well.\n\n- Widely used against mech, because Roaches scale better in those situations compared to Zerglings and Banelings.\n\n- Widely used in various early-game pushes, including the infamous 9-roach build.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nRoaches are often acquired later than usual due to the presence of the bane/ling meta of early ZvZ. However, certain pros focus on larvae efficient Roach/Ravager timing pushes, which are more steady than the micro intensive baneling micro.\n\n## External links\n\n- 2016-12-10 | soO's Roach Control (ZvZ) by Shaft of Polygon Gaming\n\n- Analysis of slow Roaches against Marines", "question": "Which upgrade increases the Roach's movement speed while unburrowed to 4.2 (+1.05) and to 4.4 while burrowed under creep?", "options": ["Glial Reconstitution", "Tunneling Claws", "Rapid Regeneration", "Morph to Ravager"], "answer": "Glial Reconstitution"}

{"document": "# Blue Flame Hellion Drop Timing\n## Execution\n### Followup\n\nThere are many followups to this build.  The best followup is dependent on what you scout the Zerg doing, as well as how risky you want to play.  Keep in mind that the variability of the followups associated with its build is a very strong point that you should make use of, especially in series play.\n\nThere are a few general guidelines that will help you better understand the available followups:\n\n- Keeping an eye on the drone count at the natural expansion is key.  If the Zerg is saturating the natural relatively quickly, then you have a window for an early attack, but you must get there are quickly as possible, preferably in the 8:30-9:00 range.\n\n- You do not actually need to tech any further nor do you need to expand.  If you can keep the Zerg in the dark about whether you are expanding and whether you are teching, you will have won yourself an important victory in the battle for scarce information.\n\n- If you opt for a stim push, it is best that you start stim slightly before 6:00, and make sure you move out before stim is done if you have ascertained that moving out is actually safe.  Whether or not it is safe to move out is something you will have to determine using your Hellions.  The goal is to engage at the Zerg's natural just as stim finishes.  However, if you opt for a stim push, you will not be able to attack with an effective siege push.  Thus you will have to choose whether to go with stim or whether to go with siege mode after the initial Hellion harass and Blue Flame tech.\n\n- Do not build your extra two Barracks until you have 300 free minerals.  At this point, build the Barracks simultaneously.", "question": "In the context of the Blue Flame Hellion drop timing, what is the optimal time range to execute an early attack if the Zerg is quickly saturating their natural expansion?", "options": ["6:00-6:30", "7:30-8:00", "8:30-9:00", "9:30-10:00"], "answer": "8:30-9:00"}

{"document": "# Gate Nexus YufFE (vs. Zerg)\n## Scouting\n\nIn PvZ, it is normal to 9 scout to check for 6 Pool and other Early Pool Builds.

Scouting after the second Pylon or Nexus will be at an appropriate time to see an expansion at the Zerg's base. If not, it is likely that the Zerg is using a one base all-in. The standard Hatchery-first builds start the expansion around the 2-3 minute mark.\n\nIt is best to build your Nexus and go scout afterwards. This is around the 3 minute mark and would be early enough to see a 6-7 pool running towards your base. This is good and most economical on four-player maps like Tal'darim Altar, since even Pylon scouting does not always find Zerg's base in time to scout 6 pools. On maps like Shakuras Plateau or Ohana you can scout after your second Pylon, because you will see all Zerglings running to your base.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with late scouting, you can scout earlier.

{"document": "# Snipe\n\nSnipe\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):Ghost\nCost: 25\nRange:10\nCooldown:0.5 s\nResearched from:No research needed\n\nSnipe is an offensive spell used by the Terran Ghost to quickly eliminate vital Biological units in the opposing army. The Snipe spell can be used while the Ghost is cloaked and deals 25 (+25 vs Psionic) damage to an enemy unit regardless of armor.\n\n## Use\n\nIn competitive play Snipe can be used to quickly dispatch enemy caster units such as the Protoss High Templar and the Zerg Infestor, as both can be killed with only two shots at long range. At its range of 10, it also out-ranges the High Templar´s Feedback by 1, (9 range) and the Infestor´s Fungal Growth by 2 (8 range), though it has a 0.5 second casting animation. While Snipe can be used for picking off all units carrying the Biological attribute, units featuring the Light attribute are rarely worth the necessary APM-Investment, as it would only result in a marginal amount of additional damage compared to the 20 (excluding upgrades) damage that a Ghost deals with its general attack against light units.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nSince it takes two EMP Rounds to stop a full-energy High Templar from casting Psionic Storm, Snipe is often times used instead of EMP, especially if the High Templars are spread apart (reducing the effectiveness of EMP's AoE). It takes two Snipes to kill a High Templar. By killing the High Templars rather than simply draining their energy, the Terran player also prevents them from being morphed into Archons during the engagement.\n\nDue to the 0.5 second starting animation delay of Snipe, Feedback from a High Templar can often times kill a Ghost before he is able to Snipe a second time.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nIs rarely used, since the only Terran unit that has the Psionic affix is the Ghost.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nInfestors and Vipers are both Psionic and take full damage from Snipe, requiring two and four Snipes to kill, respectively. Snipe can also be used to quickly dispatch Queens, which take four Snipes to kill.\n\n## Other\n\n- Can be cast on friendly units\n\n- Can be cast on Larvae\n\n- Cannot be cast on Structures\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nSnipe can be very effective against Protoss High Templars in combination with EMP if the Protoss opponent is not microing his Templars effectively. Casting EMP and then sniping the enemy Templars can be devastating to Protoss ground attacks.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Ghosts : Using Snipe efficiently! by justicewoot - Good discussion thread about the various methods of queuing up snipes.", "question": "How many Snipes are required to kill a Zerg Infestor?", "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "answer": "2"}

A Leviathan is also used between missions for the Heart of the Swarm campaign,[1] and one can be summoned in battle with different stats.\n\n## Campaign Specifics\n\n### Shatter The Sky\n\nDuring the single player mission Campaign/Shatter the Sky the Leviathan will appear after the second Coolant Tower is destroyed accompanied by a brief cutscene where it is described as the largest Zerg creature on record. It will then patrol the center of the map, spawning more air units for the player to deal with until it is killed.\n\n### All In\n\nDuring the final campaign mission, Campaign/All-In if the player didn't kill the Leviathan in the Shatter The Sky mission, or opted not to do that mission at all, the Leviathan will join the fight around 70% charge on the artifact and will stay out of reach of your defenses. It will once again continue to launch additional air units for the player to deal with until killed.\n\n## Abilities\n\nThe Leviathan has the ability to launch Mutalisks and Brood Lords for no energy cost without a cooldown, although the AI will spawn them over time or slightly faster in response to being attacked. The units spawn as eggs or cocoons as appropriate and will spawn in to the units after a few seconds.\n\nAdditionally the Leviathan has a direct attack which requires 125 energy in which it will launch a powerful single target attack, much like a Yamato Cannon. This attack deals 500 damage and has a 6 second cooldown.\n\nThe final ability this unit has is Bio-Stasis. This is a small area of effect attack which deals no damage but stuns all effected units, preventing them from performing any action for 10 seconds. This ability costs 125 energy and has a 20 second cooldown.", "question": "What is the primary damage dealt by the Leviathan's direct attack ability?", "options": ["500 damage", "200 damage", "300 damage", "400 damage"], "answer": "500 damage"}
{"document": "# Mining Minerals\n## Optimizing Mineral Harvesting\n### Approximate Absolute Rates\n\nThe first and second workers on a single mineral patch will each collect approximately 40 minerals per minute.\nThe third worker will collect approximately 20 minerals per minute.\n\nEach saturated mineral patch (3 workers) will yield approximately 102 minerals/minute.\n\nSlight Rate Differences Due to Distance Variation\n\nA mineral patch with 1 worker will yield between X (closest possible patch distance) and Y (farthest possible patch distance) minerals/minute.\n(the numbers for 2 workers on a patch would be exactly double that of 1 worker, since there is no waiting time incurred by the 2nd worker)\n\nGas\n\nEach of the three workers on a single geyser will collect approximately 38 gas per minute, with saturation at approximately 114 gas/min.\n\nDistance Variations\n\nA very close gas geyser may collect gas faster when having only 1 or 2 workers on it, but once they get a 3rd, the rates become exactly the same, due to the waiting of a worker at all times.\n\nExceptions\n\nVery far gas geysers (common on some maps) may actually require 4 workers for full saturation, although having 3 workers on such a geyser results in only a ~10% decrease in your gas output. These geysers are generally the \"far corner\" placements. You can usually notice easily that the geyser is farther than normal.\n\nMultiplied Out\n\nAn expansion will yield an average of 228 gas per game minute (114/geyser x2).\n\nRegular expos (which have 8 patches) 24 workers will yield approximately 816 minerals per game minute (102/patch x8)\n\nAn island expo (7 patches), 21 workers, 714 minerals per game minute\n\nand a gold expo (6 patches), 18 workers, 856 minerals per game minute.

After partial saturation (in this case, 2 workers per patch), each worker will return on its initial investment 153(±4) seconds after the initial investment.  In such cases, when an alternate base is available, it may be best to send workers there if that base is not saturated to two workers per patch yet.  These numbers remain valid as long as the worker is built from the base location adjacent to the mineral patches, and as long as those minerals are standard yield minerals.\n\nFor Protoss, a fully chrono boosted probe will realize its investment 6 seconds earlier, due to the reduced build time.", "question": "What is the approximate mineral collection rate per minute for a saturated mineral patch (with 3 workers) in StarCraft II?", "options": ["90 minerals/minute", "102 minerals/minute", "114 minerals/minute", "120 minerals/minute"], "answer": "102 minerals/minute"}

{"document": "# Hotkeys\n## Overview\n\nHotkeys execute actions by pressing a key. Hotkeys are bound to predefined actions and cannot be changed mid-game.1 For example, a Barracks will produce one Marine when the A key is struck. Because there is no mouse movement, using the hotkey is faster than clicking on the Marine icon after selecting the Barracks.\n\nNote that any hotkeys listed in this article assume the default hotkey settings, using a standard American QWERTY keyboard. If you use an alternate keyboard layout through the Windows layout manager, hotkeys will function as if you were using a QWERTY keyboard, but will be relabeled to accommodate your keyboard - that is to say, if you have an A key where the Q key would be for QWERTY, most hotkeys will treat an A as a Q. However, keyboard layout changes made through other methods (registry editors like Sharpkeys, for example, or hardware-mapped keyboard layouts) are invisible to StarCraft 2's client, and you must adjust the hotkeys as necessary.\n\nHotkeys also refers to keys that can be assigned to units and buildings or locations. Units and buildings are assigned to the number keys (1-0) along the top row of the keyboard. Locations are assigned to F5 through F8. To assign units or buildings to a hotkey (sometimes called a control group), select the units you wish to assign and then press Ctrl+# where # is the key you want to assign them to. If you wish to add units to a control group without overwriting the units already in the group you may also press Shift+#.\n\nHotkeys are stored in the account profile folder in your Windows My Documents folder. You can manually edit the hotkey file, and, although probably illegal for tournament play, there are a lot of fun tricks only possible this way. For example, more than 2 keys can be assigned to the same action. Although not considered a hack, this sort of editing is outside the scope of this article, and maybe breaks the wiki's rules anyway. Google it.\n\n1. Hotkeys can be changed mid-game, but doing so in a multiplayer game is difficult, since the game is not paused. In single-player modes, however, it is easy.

{"document": "# 4 Warpgate Rush\n## Execution\n### PvP\n\n- Protoss players generally want to target fire enemy Stalkers with their own Stalkers at all times, as whoever has the greater number of Stalkers will have an advantage in terms of micro-management potential. However, the 4 Gating Protoss may opt for a high number of Zealots if they are trying to charge up a ramp that their opponent is defending with ranged units, which is because the Zealots will force the opponent to move their ranged units away from the ramp.\n\n- Certain builds designed to counter the 4 Gate, such as the 3 Stalker Rush, rely heavily on sniping the proxy Probe before a proxy Pylon is built. As such, the 4 Gating Protoss must make sure to cradle their proxy Probe until proxy Pylons can be built. If you scout that the opponent is going for a 3 Stalker Rush, you may even consider taking along additional Probes to make sniping them harder.\n\n- It's important to note that on some maps, such as Bel'Shir Beach and Tal'Darim Altar, the 4 Gate is the dominant strategy because it is impossible to use Force Fields to prevent units being warped into the main base. This is because there is no ramp between the main base and the natural.

{"document": "# Corruptor (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\n- General purpose - The Corruptor can maintain air-supremacy over most Protoss Air in small numbers. However, Protoss air units become more and more powerful vs the Corruptor later on. This is due to the potency of the Void Ray's Prismatic Alignment ability, Carriers, and Tempests, in larger numbers, as well as the fact that Phoenixes with increased range outrange and outmobilize Corruptors.  As such, Corruptors are typically used to complement other forms of anti-air against air-focused Protoss play as the game progresses.\n\n- With Mutalisks - Corruptors complement Mutalisk play very nicely when used to zone out Phoenixes.  While Phoenix grow more effective versus both Corruptors and Mutalisks as the game progresses, Corruptors are very strong in aggressively establishing control over Protoss territory for Mutalisk counterattacks and base trade scenarios.\n\n- Against Colossus - Corruptors are sometimes massed to snipe the Colossi in a Protoss composition, similar to how Terran uses Vikings. The Corruptor is a hard counter to Colossi because the Colossi can be targeted by Anti-Air, is considered a Massive unit, and does not have anti-air attacks of its own.\n\n- Late game - Massed Corruptors can be useful when used in conjunction with Vipers in defensive territory.  Since most late game Protoss units are very expensive, Viper abducts on units such as Colossi, Void Rays, Carriers, and Tempests can significantly hinder Protoss attempts to attack a Zerg establishment.", "question": "Which Zerg unit is considered a hard counter to Protoss Colossi due to its anti-air capabilities and the Colossi's inability to attack air units?", "options": ["Mutalisk", "Corruptor", "Viper", "Ultralisk"], "answer": "Corruptor"}

It allows for both early aggression with a highly micro-able unit, thorough scouting of an enemy's base (and of the map in the case of TvT and TvP), and an elegant balance of early gas spending and mineral saving which allows for a relatively fast Command Center.\n\nBecause of the Reaper FE, many Zerg players will elect to take a very early gas and mine just 100 gas in order to get Zergling speed. This allows for them to shut down the Reaper if it is still on their side of the map when it is finished. The standard Reaper FE that leads into 4M play moves straight into Hellions and then into 4M. This allows for the Terran player to deal easily with the speed Zerglings that he forced while he is powering up to his mid game of choice.\n\nReaper FE is a very map dependent opening. Map features to look for that enhance the build are cliffs that you can jump up into the main without having to be in the natural (Neo Planet S or Star Station), naturals with both a cliff and a wide normal entrance (Bel'Shir Vestige), or other features that allow multiple paths of attack for the Reapers. Maps that are not very good for Reaper FE include those with no jump-able entrance to the main from outside the natural and a single path into the natural (Whirlwind).\n\nSome Zerg players will send two Zerglings to your natural while you are harassing them with your Reaper(s). The goal the Zerg has with this move is to kill the SCV building the command center. If this happens and you do not have anything at home to repel it, you will be at a disadvantage. To prevent this from happening, either leave one Reaper at home near the building command center or build the command center inside your main base.\n\nYour first Reaper should harass any Drones in the Zerg natural and then find a way into the main to check the Zerg's extractor timing. It is important to note that Zergling speed can be finished as soon as three minutes and 15 seconds after the Extractor is done. You want your Reapers to be gone before this time is up. The primary goal is not to kill Drones or cause damage, but to force the Zerg into getting very fast Zergling Speed or to punish him for not doing so.

Although similar to the Spore Colony, the Spore Crawler has the distinct ability to Uproot itself and Root in a new location, giving it very good mobility and a more flexible use. Take note that Spore Crawlers lose their detection ability while uprooted.\n\nSpore Crawlers are used in ZvZ to protect against a lot of Mutalisks. In HotS the Spore Crawler was buffed to 30 damage vs biological units. This was reverted for LotV to 15, because Viper have Parasitic Bomb to deal with large numbers of Mutalisks.\n\nSpore Crawlers have excellent endurance and deal more damage per second than Photon Cannons, but not as much as Missile Turrets. It depends how many AA structures or units are on the field. Queens are typically used to fill gaps in early game air defense, and Hydralisks remain more versatile on the move.\n\nSpore Crawlers, like all air defenses, are most effective when tightly packed.

This is a good strategy because Void Rays and Stalkers will often out-range the Terran's defensive units.\n\n- If the enemy's mineral line is close to a ledge (for instance, Metalopolis), then Void Rays can be used to safely kill the enemy's workers and to draw their units away from their ramp, which may allow you to attack up the ramp more easily.\n\n- If the enemy has a bunkered natural expansion, then you should use a low ground Pylon and the Void Ray's vision to warp Zealots into their main base. This will draw units away from their Bunkers, allowing you to go for a frontal attack with your remaining units and Void Rays. Alternatively, you can use Force Fields to prevent the Terran units defending their main base, allowing your Zealots and Void Rays to quickly kill a number of enemy workers/buildings.\n\n- Conserve units at all costs.

{"document": "# Generate Creep\n\nGenerate Creep\nAbility Information\nCaster(s):Overlord\nCost: Minerals: 0  0\nDuration:0 (Overlord)\nResearched from:No research needed\n\nWhen activated, the Overlord will create Zerg creep beneath it, spreading out to a 2x2 area. Overlords will only do this when stationary. When the Overlord is moved or commanded to stop the generated creep will disappear.\nRequires a Lair to be used.\n\n## Use\n\nThis ability is most often used to spread the Zerg player's creep, expanding it just like the Creep Tumor to enable their units to move faster in a larger area. As opposed to the Creep Tumor's ability to spread creep, it does not need a connection to already-existing creep, so Overlords can place creep in anywhere on the map. This can be used to hide important tech structures such as the Spire and surprise the opponent with an unexpected tech switch.\n\nAlternatively, it can be used to delay Terran and Protoss expansion for some time since Terran or Protoss buildings can not be built on creep. It takes 45 game seconds for the creep to disappear completely, so it can be worthwhile to delay expansions in the mid-late game even if the Overlord is killed, as it will probably delay more than the 100 minerals it would take to replace the Overlord.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nOverlord's Generate Creep can be used for faster creep spreading via Creep Tumors, you can use Overlords to Generate Creep at the maximum range of the Tumor so that you do not need to wait for the Creep to spread normally. You can also build Tumors over cliff faces where the creep would normally not spread to.\n\n## Loss of the Lair (or Hive)\n\nWhen a base trade commences, or any other scenario that results in the death of the last remaining Lair and Hive, the option to activate Generate Creep on the Overlord is lost. However, all Overlords already generating creep retain this ability until the player manually switches it off.

{"document": "# Tempest (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\nTempests can be best used against an immobile mech army, using the range difference in order to slowly pick away at the Terran force. In this way the Tempests start a clock timer, forcing the Terran to make a choice: either move forward into a position that might not be too favorable and try to engage the Tempests; or back off and lose the position it currently holds. Waiting is punished by slowly getting picked apart by the Tempests. Even a few Tempests can be sufficient to provoke this reaction.\n\nAgainst bio, the Tempests may be useful against supporting units like tanks, but Marines with stim can close the distance rapidly against isolated Tempests and destroy them in relative ease. Disruptors or Colossus can protect the Tempests by discouraging the enemy infantry army from moving in.\n\nOther responses to the Tempest from the Terran player might include building a lot of Vikings. This gives more space to the Protoss ground army as it takes away production time from other essential units. A mech player may possibly use Thors more. Thors are capable units with high durability and DPS, but Tempests are generally easier to micro due to lack of collision, applying damage more consistently, and they are also slightly faster so can avoid engagement with the Thors by running away.

Trapped units cannot move, attack or use abilities, nor be attacked or affected by abilities. The Protoss player may use the time to achieve a favorable army placement.\n\nThe Stasis Ward expires after 170 seconds or when triggering its Stasis Trap ability.\n\n## Abilities\n\nStasis Trap\nCaster: Stasis Ward\nDuration: 21\nTraps nearby enemies in stasis for 21 seconds. Trapped units cannot be attacked or affected by abilities.\n\nPermanent Cloak\nThe Stasis Ward is permanently cloaked.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\n### General\n\nThe Oracle is generally used for its Pulsar Beam ability in the early game to harass and its Revelation ability in the late-game to keep tabs on the enemy army, and thusly Stasis Ward is a niche ability. Stasis wards can be placed in choke points to delay enemy attacks and to give the defending player time to respond. If an enemy army partially moves onto a Stasis Ward, the Protoss can engage and deal with each portion of the army at different times, gaining a large advantage. The stasis victim will be forced to delay with the rest of his army and wait for the stasis to expire, or retreat and abandon the frozen forces altogether.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nSince Oracles are usually made in the late-game anyways for Revelation, some Stasis Wards may be built. A few Stasis Wards on an expansion can help deal with a Zealot or Dark Templar run-by, allowing more time to react. Stasis Wards with Disruptors appear threatening, but Stalkers can avoid being frozen fairly easily with their Blink ability. The Stasis time does not offer as much of a window for aggression as in the other matchups, because of the difficulty of engaging into an enemy Disruptor army.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nSince Terran bio armies do not usually accompany their main force with a mobile detector, Oracles left over from the early-game can surprise entire bio forces with a few well-placed stasis mines. They are not usually effective against a bio-based harassing force, however, since the autocast on the stasis mine will only catch the first units to be unloaded from a Medivac.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nStasis wards can be effective at denying an enemy Zergling run-by, as a single Stasis Ward can trap a handful of Zerglings, and a Zealot warp-in can handle the rest. A Stasis Ward can also be placed behind the wall at the natural, so that if a pack of Zerglings attempts to run in, the mine will activate and the frozen Zerglings will block the rest from entering, allowing the Protoss to react.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Stasis Wards will neither be triggered by nor trap Larvae or Cocoons (all kinds).\n\n- There is a very short delay between the Stasis Trap's being triggered and units' being trapped. With crisp timing, this allows certain units to trigger and remove Stasis Wards without becoming trapped:\nStalkers can Blink out of the affected area, Dark Templars can use Shadow Stride.\nTransport air units (Medivacs, Warp Prisms and Overlords with Ventral Sacs) may drop a single unit next to the Stasis Ward and immediately pick it back up.\nAdepts can activate Psionic Transfer and run into the activation range just as the Shade is about to expire. This micro feat is typically performed against Widow Mines which offer a far less punishing (longer) time window.\n\n- Stalkers can Blink out of the affected area, Dark Templars can use Shadow Stride.\n\n- Transport air units (Medivacs, Warp Prisms and Overlords with Ventral Sacs) may drop a single unit next to the Stasis Ward and immediately pick it back up.\n\n- Adepts can activate Psionic Transfer and run into the activation range just as the Shade is about to expire.

{"document": "# All-In\n## Ambiguity\n\nMany viewers are quick to call All-In in cases that aren't necessarily All-Ins. Being All-In is context reliant and cannot usually be pin-pointed without sufficient information. For example:\n\n- If a Zerg player begins producing Roaches off one base this suggests an All-In as they aren't going for an economic opening, but the zerg player may choose to play passively and work towards a later economy.\n\n- A Terran player could bring a portion of his SCVs with an early game attack. If the attack fails, the Terran may still be in a survivable position due to usage of MULEs or a tight wall.\n\n- A 4 Gate is an All-In, because it cuts probes at 20 or 21. However, if probes are built constantly and an expansion is built at a reasonable time, this strategy puts more pressure on an opponent than 1Gate-FE, but you have to deal damage or you will be behind in tech and worker count. It might be called a \"Semi-All-In\", but like #2 the Protoss might be in a survivable position after the attack.\n\nOne base, or low-econ strategies are often incorrectly referred to as All-In. If a one-basing player cuts economic growth to execute his strategy, and his opponent cuts military production to execute their strategy, both players are vying for a different type of advantage. Each has the potential to lose the game, but neither is necessarily an All-In.\n\nSince the Meta-Game changed from 1Base-Play to strategies with a fast expansion, some people call a \"3 Gate Robo\" an All-In. 1Base-Play cannot produce as much workers as a player with two bases, but an early attack may deal damage (e.g. kill workers).", "question": "Which of the following strategies is considered an All-In in StarCraft II?", "options": ["4 Gate", "1Gate-FE", "3 Gate Robo", "Fast Expansion"], "answer": "4 Gate"}

{"document": "# Hotkeys\n## Group Hotkeys aka Control Groups\n### Strategies for Using\n\nThe most common way to use your 10 hotkeys is to divide the keys into unit groups and building groups. Most Starcraft II players are finding that 4 unit control groups is usually sufficient; so keys 1 - 4 are assigned to unit groups while keys 5 - 0 are used for groups of buildings. You should experiment to find the key combinations which feel the most natural and easy to use for you.\n\nWhatever scheme you select, it is best to be consistent. Muscle memory is most effective when each key always does the same thing.\n\nUnits may belong to multiple groups. For example, perhaps as a Terran player you'd like to have all of your Marines and Marauders move together as a unit, but when fighting, you'd like your Marauders to focus fire on armored units. You could assign all your infantry to group 1 then create group 2 with only the Marauders.\n\nWith the release of Legacy of the Void, Alt+#  is now used to remove selected units from all previous control groups when assigned to a new control group.", "question": "In StarCraft II, which key combination can be used to remove selected units from all previous control groups when assigning them to a new control group?", "options": ["Ctrl+#", "Shift+#", "Alt+#", "Fn+#"], "answer": "Alt+#"}

{"document": "# EMP Round\n\nEMP Round\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):Ghost\nCost: 75\nRange:10\nRadius:1.75\nResearched from:No research needed\n\nEMP Round  (or EMP for short) is an offensive spell that is especially useful against Protoss. Within the targeted area all units and buildings lose up to 100 shields and 100 energy, and cloaked units (permanently cloaked, via a spell, or by the  Mothership ability, but not burrowed) are revealed for 10 in-game seconds (or roughly 7 seconds when playing with Faster speed).\n\n## Use\n\nEMP is mainly useful against Protoss forces and any large clump of caster units.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nCan be used on the brunt of the Protoss force to quickly reduce shields and energy. Losing 100 shields in one shot is very devastating to Protoss armies, and will turn the tide of battle quickly towards the Terran player if used effectively. EMP is particularly effective on Archons, who only have 10hp after all their shields are removed, as well as Sentries, High Templars, and Oracles, as the loss of energy minimizes their offensive potential and intensifies their fragility.\n\nEMP works well with Yamato Cannon for quickly killing Carriers or Colossus.\n\nIf you expect a medivac drop to meet high templar, EMP can also be used on the medivac beforehand to prevent feedback from damaging or destroying the drop.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nEMP is least used against Terran. Likely the best uses of EMP against another Terran would be to sap energy from enemy Medivacs so they cannot heal, or to eliminate Banshees' ability to cloak. It can also be used against Terran Orbital Commands to remove energy for scans or other abilities. Bothersome Ravens, their Point Defense Drones can also be effective targets of EMP. During team play, enemy Ghosts can also be a priority.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nEMP is becoming more useful against Zerg because of an increase in the usage of Infestors. Burning their energy is very essential, especially in large battles. Fungal Growth can root your units long enough to allow the Zerg army to easily run them over and Neural Parasite can take control of key units (i.e. Thors and Tanks) that can completely turn the tide of battle, so it is important to prevent such spells from being cast.\n\n## Other\n\n- Can be cast on friendly units.\n\n- Can be used to reveal any cloaked units such as Dark Templars and Observers, and units under a Mothership.\n\n- Can be cast on buildings, with the same effects as on units.\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ Blizzard Entertainment (21 August 2019). \"STARCRAFT II 4.10.1 Balance Updates\".

{"document": "# High Templar (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n\nEssentially, Protoss players in the mid-game transition have two broad strategic options: either Colossus or High Templar. Because both of these units are expensive and serve similar purposes with their area-of-effect attacks (Psionic Storm for HT and Thermal Lances for the Colossus), most players elect for one of these tech paths for the mid-game. (In late game, it is not uncommon to see both HT and Colossus deployed on the battlefield at the same time, however.)\n\nAlthough it has an almost harmless attack and is relatively weak in terms of hit points and shields, the very powerful Psionic Storm can be vital for the success of Protoss. The unit is warped in with 50 energy, enough for one Feedback spell but not enough for a Psionic Storm (75 energy). It takes 45 seconds to get the additional 25 energy required for a storm. Common strategy is to warp in High Templars at locations to defend drops with feedback and then move them to the army when they have the desired amount of energy.\nThe most common use for the High Templar is casting Psionic Storm on large numbers of small units such as Marines, Zerglings, or workers.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of the High Templar in the mid-game for Protoss players?", "options": ["To serve as a frontline combat unit", "To provide area-of-effect damage with Psionic Storm", "To scout enemy movements", "To repair damaged units"], "answer": "To provide area-of-effect damage with Psionic Storm"}
{"document": "# Unit Positioning\n## General Ideas Behind Unit Positioning & Flanking\n### Ball\n\nThe main units which tend to ball up are Marines, Marauders, and Zerglings. The best way to think about a ball is merely a Convex curve that has been folded in on itself many times. Thus, a ball is the most defensive position that a unit composition can take since it vastly decreases the risk of the innermost units being attacked. Its obvious disadvantage is splash damage since all of the units are bunched together.  A more extreme version of this is the deathball (see below).\n\nUnit positioning is extremely important with the Ball formation. It's best to put heavier units, Marauders, at the outside while keeping weaker units, Marines, on the inside. This decreases the chance of the weaker units being destroyed quickly by splash damage (Banelings, Siege Tanks, Infestors) and allows these high DPS units to fire upon the enemy.\n\nAnother possible way to counter the Ball formation is to use ranged units with a very long range. In this manner, you can then use an infinite concave curve (circle) to surround the opponent completely. In this manner, the outer ring of units can be taken out while the inner units do not have the range to fire outside of the ball. This can be particularly hard to achieve as the ball must be caught off guard in an open area while you have units which can engage in this fashion from afar.", "question": "In the context of the Ball formation in StarCraft II, which unit positioning strategy is recommended to protect weaker units from splash damage?", "options": ["Place Zerglings on the outside and Marines on the inside", "Put Marauders on the outside and Marines on the inside", "Keep all units evenly distributed", "Position Banelings in the center of the ball"], "answer": "Put Marauders on the outside and Marines on the inside"}
{"document": "# Random\n\nIn addition to choosing one of the three main races (Protoss, Terran, or Zerg), players may also choose Random at the beginning of a Starcraft match, giving them an equal chance of spawning as each of the three races.\n\n## Advantages\n\nThe main advantage lies in the first few minutes of the game where, since build orders are often dependent on an opponent's race, playing Random forces an opponent to scout your race before solidifying their opening strategy.  Also, the opponent is much less likely to cheese with your race unknown.  For tournaments it is also hard to practice against Random, or have a game plan beforehand, because you do not know which race you will face until the game begins. Despite that advantage, pros almost always pick a race as the three races are very different in their style and mechanics.\n\nSome players choose Random for no reason other than the desire to play all three races equally.

{"document": "# Dark Templar (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nAgainst the Zerg, Dark Templar are a strong early game option since Overlords are not Detectors by default. To get detection, Zerg needs to build a Spore Crawler (which itself is vulnerable to DT attack). Alternatively, the Zerg player can morph a Lair and then morph an Overlord into an Overseer. Either option arguably requires more time and investment of resources than comparable detection strategies from Terran and Protoss. Since Zerg are often low on gas, Zergs tend to avoid transforming Overlords into Overseers due to the high gas cost and thus leave themselves open to Dark Templar harass and Dark Templar openings.\n\nAs in PvP, the PvZ Dark Templar harass typically ends with the opponent's first Overseer. Leftover Dark Templar may be merged into Archons, typically more useful units in the presence of Overseers. Additionally, continued judicious use of Dark Templar can punish Zerg players who do not morph a sufficient number of overseers and/or fail to place them optimally. In particular, late-game DT \"drops\" into the main base of Zerg can quickly snipe tech buildings.", "question": "Why might Zerg players avoid transforming Overlords into Overseers when facing Dark Templar harassment?", "options": ["Overseers are less effective against Dark Templar", "Overseers require a large investment of minerals", "Overseers require a high investment of gas", "Overseers are too slow to react to Dark Templar"], "answer": "Overseers require a high investment of gas"}

The file sizes are still relatively small and average about 100kb for a 15 minute game. Replays are saved and stored in a special folder called \"StarCraft II\" in the user's Documents folder. If you disconnect from Battle.net while watching a replay you will be able to continue watching the replay until you exit the replay, where you will have to reconnect.\n\n## Features\n\nThe StarCraft II Replay system has a number of improvements and new features compared to Brood War replays. These are listed below.\n\nHeart of the Swarm introduced new features like:\n\n- Take command\n\n- Watch with others\n\n- Restart Replay - Ctrl + E\n\n- Switch player names: First Ctrl + N and afterwards Ctrl + X\n\n- Workers active\n\n### Rewinding\n\nAs you play through a replay, you can now jump back to any point in the replay that you have already seen and view it again. To go forward is not possible, but Faster x8 (Speed) will help.\n\nYou may also press B in order to quickly rewind 15 seconds.\n\n### Player Selection\n\nYou can see a human players selection. E. g. a selected Marine will show a dashed circle around it. If Red selects a unit the circle will be red. In general the circle is in the players colour and what commands are being issued.\n\n### Player Camera\n\nYou can view a players First-Person view at any time to see exactly what they were doing at any point in time. Each player gets a number. In a 1v1 between MC and MMA, 1 is assigned to MC and 2 is assigned to MMA for example. If you choose \"Everything (E)\", you can switch temporaliy into the vision of a specific player. By holding V when having a unit of one player selected, your vision will switch to that of the player until you release V.\n\n### Unit Following\n\nYou can lock the camera to any unit to follow it around the map. To do this select the unit and press Ctrl + F.\n\n### Replay Overlay\n\nAn overlay in the top left displays various information for every player as chosen by the viewer. These options are listed below.\n\nPatch 1.3.0 introduced several new features and Patch 1.3.3 changed the Current APM hotkey. These are listed below:\n\n- In a 1v1 game, both players’ resource rows are shown in the upper right at the same time.\n\n- The main game UI can now be hidden/shown by pressing Ctrl + W.\n\n- The ability to toggle between player unit colors and team unit colors when watching a replay or observing by pressing Alt + F.\n\n- New bigger panels are now available when observing or viewing a replay of 1v1 games.

{"document": "# Marauder (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nCommonly seen in Bio vs. Mech or Bio-Mech vs. Mech games, Marauders are typically mixed in with Marines for the following reasons:\n\n- Marauders do +10 damage against Armored units, which is helpful against Mech compositions whose primary damage dealer is the Siege Tank.\n\n- Since Marauders do more damage per attack than Marines but fire at a slower rate, they can be stutter stepped more efficiently than Marines as they can cover more distance between each attack while still maintaining full DPS. Coupled with their slightly longer range, this allows Marauders to be more mobile than Marines when micromanaged against Siege Tanks in a direct engagement.\n\n- Although Siege Tanks deal bonus damage to Armored units like the Marauder, Marauders have larger unit models than Marines, reducing the effectiveness of Siege Tanks' splash damage as they will hit less units with each attack.\n\n- Marauder's slowing effect from Concussive Shells is effective against Hellions and prevents Siege Tanks from retreating.\n\n- Since they have the Armored instead of Light Attribute, they do not take bonus damage from Hellions or Hellbats, unlike Marines.\n\nIn Bio-Mech vs. Bio-Mech games, Marauders are often times forgone entirely, as they are both resource inefficient and supply inefficient against Marines in large battles.", "question": "Why are Marauders often used in conjunction with Marines in Bio vs. Mech or Bio-Mech vs. Mech games in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Marauders have a faster attack rate than Marines, making them more effective in direct engagements.", "Marauders are more effective against Armored units, such as Siege Tanks, due to their +10 damage bonus.", "Marauders have a shorter range than Marines, making them ideal for close combat.", "Marauders are more efficient in resource and supply usage compared to Marines in large battles."], "answer": "Marauders are more effective against Armored units, such as Siege Tanks, due to their +10 damage bonus."}

Each Carrier warps in with an initial set of 4 Interceptors that can attack immediately. Additional Interceptors are trained in the Carrier itself. Each Carrier can support a maximum of 8 Interceptors at any one time. Unlike most offensive units, Interceptors require no supply points.\n\nWhen a Carrier attacks, Interceptors launch and then attack automatically in a swarm around their Carrier. They return to the Carrier that launched them when the Carrier moves away or there are no more targets in range.

Interceptors are not individually selectable, and they cannot be given orders directly. When given no specific target, Interceptors are free to attack any target in range. They automatically prioritize targets with anti-air capabilities that might harm the Carrier or destroy the Interceptors themselves. Individually, each Interceptor is relatively weak, but in large numbers, their collective firepower can quickly overwhelm opponents.\n\nAt the start of Legacy of the Void, Interceptors were able to be released by the Carrier.

Players tend to have more flexibility on these maps to open with a wider variety of strategies and/or builds.\n\n- Macro A map that favors defensive play and encourages players to reach end game unit compositions.\n\n- Challenge Design a map making use of the “Acceleration Zone Generator” structure. Pre-place these structures on maps as Player 0 and the structure will be neutral to all players. Even before they are revealed, these structures will display a mini-map icon at the start of matches to indicate their locations.\n\n- Rush Map favors early aggression and offensive play.\n\nThe 16 finalists [48] formed the map pool of the WardiTV Team Liquid Map Contest Tournament 6. After being modified based on the games shown in the tournament as well as feedback from the judges, the finalists were voted on by the public [49] with the following results[50]:\n\n- Blackburn by Insidioussc2 (Rush)\n\n- 2000 Atmospheres by themusic246 (Standard)\n\n- Lightshade by Marras (Standard)\n\n- Beckett Industries by Superouman (Challenge)\n\n- Submarine by Zweck (Rush)\n\n- Bamboozle by ObsidianScabbard (Macro)\n\n- Jagannatha by Timmay (Challenge)\n\n- Oxide by themusic246 (Rush)\n\n- Romanticide by Marras (Macro)\n\n- Ice and Chrome by themusic246 (Macro)\n\n- Ecostation by CharactR (Macro)\n\n- Hard Rain by ATTx (Standard)\n\n- Pillars of Gold by Agaton (Standard)\n\n- Deathaura by Marras (Challenge)\n\n- Old Forgotten Temple by robeng (Rush)\n\n- Impostor by insidious_bombardier (Challenge)", "question": "Which type of StarCraft II map is designed to favor defensive play and encourage players to reach end-game unit compositions?", "options": ["Standard", "Macro", "Rush", "Challenge"], "answer": "Macro"}

{"document": "# Adel's Late Gas (vs. Protoss)\n## Basic Build Order\n### Scouting\n\n- Do not 9 Pylon scout, as you're going to be rather safe against a wide variety of cheese compared to a standard 12-13 Gate build order.\n\n- Initially scouting is going to revolve around finding out if the other Protoss is cheesing you or not with some sort of cannon or proxy Gateway. If you see a proxy gate, proceed building your two Gateways at their normal timing, and slowly add on a third Gateway while constantly chronoboosting Zealots and adding on Pylons. If you think, you can take down the Pylon with 4 Probes, go ahead and attack. This depends on the distance from your base to the Gates.\n\n- If you do not detect any cheese, then you'll want to be sure that you hit before he has his Warp Gate research up, or at the very least force a cycle or two from his Warp Gates into his own base rather than on the offensive towards your own. Take note of how much Chronoboost the enemy is saving as a general indication of how fast your opponent will be getting Warp Gate technology up; the more Chronoboost being saved, the more early aggression or the earlier Warp Gates will arrive. You can ignore early aggression, as your two Gateways will keep you safe, so your only concern when seeing a lot of saved Chronoboost is a very early 4 gate.\n\n- In higher leagues: If you find that you are cross positions on a four player map, then this build is still viable though it is advised to focus on using your initial 2 Gate army to search for and destroy any proxy Pylons that would be warping in as the enemy prepares for a 4 Warpgate Rush. Adelscott does this in the replay on Lost Temple, as well as in the VOD on Scrap Station (links provided in the references section). In this situation you will have to rely on very good micro on top of spot-on macro to survive. It will be very important to make sure the enemy Stalker count is never above yours, which means you need to be careful on whether you warp in Stalkers or Zealots.\n\nYour early attack will reveal your opponent's tech path. Is he going for blink Stalkers?

{"document": "# All-In\n## Overview\n\nThe term All-In has its roots in Poker. A player who puts all of their money/chips into the pot on a single hand is going \"All-In\". Similarly in StarCraft, a player is considered All-In when he executes a strategy, usually a large attack that commits all their units, that has no planned follow-up.\n\nSometimes a BO is planned as an All-In (see Examples below), but on other occasions this term is relative to the state of the game being played. A player will sometimes go All-In if he feels like he is has no other options but to attempt to end the game quickly from his current position. This indicates a feeling of being behind in an unrecoverable way.\n\nOr it is the other way around and a Terran decides to \"pull the boys\" and going All-In to end the game, like it is described in \"The Big Boy Build\".\n\nAll-In strategies generally have the aim of overwhelming an opponent who has gone for a standard strategy. By cutting economics and focusing entirely on unit production for a sustained attack, players can have vastly superior armies at points not previously attainable. Due to the loss in economy players will live or die based on whether the attack is successful or not. What is All-In for a player depends somewhat on the player's skill on both sides of the fight. A weaker player may not be able to capitalise on what would be considered an All-In attack and therefore the attack would be safer.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the primary goal of an All-In strategy?", "options": ["To build a strong economy", "To overwhelm the opponent with a large, early attack", "To scout the opponent's base", "To establish a defensive position"], "answer": "To overwhelm the opponent with a large, early attack"}

{"document": "# Infernal Pre-Igniter\n## Use\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nHellions with Pre-Igniters will pretty much shut down any early-mid Zergling harass. All it takes are two Hellions to one-shot a Zergling, and due to the linear damage path of the flamethrower combined with the tendency for Zerglings to clump up, a handful of Hellions can easily dispose of large Zergling balls. Note that with the speed upgrade or creep bonus, Zerglings can catch up to and surround a Hellion, and due to the Hellion's very low rate of fire they can easily be overrun if not micromanaged properly. Hellbats deal nearly the entire Zergling's health in damage with the upgrade, which makes them both a powerful offensive unit and a protective barrier around other units like Tanks and Thors which would otherwise be vulnerable to mass Zerglings.\n\nBanelings are not considered light units, so Hellions will not do significant damage to them. However, due to the Hellion's speed, they are able to easily kite them. Note that both Hellbats and Hellions take extra damage from the Baneling's splash damage, as they are considered light units.\n\nThe Hydralisk is also a light unit, so Hellions again shine in the mid-game with support from some heavy Mech or Bio units. Be aware that better players nowadays will micro their units to spread them out as much as possible, minimizing the linear damage of the Hellion flamethrower. Many players still do not do this though, leaving their units vulnerable to heavy damage. Hellbats, although doing bonus damage, are very limited in scope here, as Hydralisks outrange them quite handily and move much faster with the speed upgrade.\n\nSince a common Zerg answer to Mech play is to make Swarm Hosts, Hellbats can be used in some situations to deal with masses of Locusts. However, since Locusts do high damage, picking them off from a distance with Tanks is still preferable unless the numbers are in favor of the Terran.\n\nThe most popular counter to Hellion-based strategies are Roaches, which shuts down Hellion harass assuming Roaches are positioned well.

{"document": "# Unit Positioning\n## General Ideas Behind Unit Positioning & Flanking\n### Convex\n\nA convex curve is one which curves away from the center point. If the concave curve is flipped along the Y-axis, you would see a convex curve. A convex curve is less aggressive than a concave curve, but it is also more defensive than a traditional concave curve. This is because there are only two sides from which a convex curve is weak - the top and the bottom. This unit positioning also requires more micro as Starcraft II naturally defaults to a concave curve.\n\nIt's extremely common for ground melee units - Zerglings and Zealots in particular - to find themselves in concave and convex curves. Generally the units which have the concave position have a large advantage due to the increased aggression that the curve naturally allows. Whichever side is in the convex position is obliged to retreat and return with more forces. In mirror matches, generally the unit composition which is concave will win a large percentage of the time. It is still possible for the convex curve to win with proper micro (retreat and return micro being the most obvious).", "question": "In StarCraft II, which type of unit positioning curve is less aggressive but more defensive, and typically requires more micro management?", "options": ["Concave", "Convex", "Linear", "Circular"], "answer": "Convex"}

{"document": "# Overlord (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Overlord is the Zerg's supply generator, equivalent to the Terran's Supply Depot and the Protoss Pylon. The Overlord provides the Zerg player with 8 supply. More must be built to create additional units.\n\nIn StarCraft II, Overlords are not Detectors like their Brood War counterparts. Instead, the Zerg morph Overlords into Overseers for mobile detection. Overseers require a Lair.\n\nOverlords may be placed around opponents' main base and natural expansion, offering information about when they have started their expansion and their army composition. Overlords and Overseers are also useful spotters for placing Nydus Worms.\n\nMany Zerg players spread out their Overlords early on, so when they have reached Lair tech they can start using the Generate Creep ability and thus expand the Creep.\n\nGood Zerg players also know when to use Overlords for setting up a chain of vision. When the threat of air attack is low, it is also advisable to place Overlords around the map in general or to allow them to patrol, spotting early enemy raiders, aerial drops or pushes. Use high ground to hide the Overlords from ground units. It is vital that a player research Pneumatized Carapace for scouting enemy bases and in order to facilitate a quick escape.\n\nOverlords are also the Zerg Transport unit. The Overlord can mutate Ventral Sacs, which in Legacy of the Void is now an upgrade performed by individual Overlords, not an upgrade for all Overlords as in WoL & HotS. Mutating Ventral Sacs changes the Overlord's appearance, denoting to the enemy that it may carry units. This can be used tactically, e.g. feigning an imminent drop using empty Overlords. Ventral Sacs require a Lair. Overlords with Ventral Sacs can still morph to Overseers, but they lose their ability to load units, and the upgrade can only be performed while the Overlord is empty. With Ventral Sacs, each Overlord has a cargo capacity of 8.\n\n| Unit | Cargo Size |\n| --- | --- |\n| Drone, Zergling | 1 |\n| Baneling, Hydralisk, Infestor, Queen, Roach | 2 |\n| Lurker, Ravager, Swarm Host | 4 |\n| Ultralisk | 8 |", "question": "What is the primary function of an Overlord when it is upgraded with Ventral Sacs in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It becomes a detector", "It gains the ability to transport units", "It can generate creep", "It becomes an Overseer"], "answer": "It gains the ability to transport units"}

Fill your second and 3rd Assimilators. Continue hitting your warp-gate cycles right on time because you're staying on 2 Gateways for a long time and you cannot afford to cut production. Your ~6:40 warp-in cycle will also be a Zealot and a Sentry, and then all subsequent warp-ins will be Zealots only. Constantly build Probes, Zealots and Pylons, and always keep your Forge Chrono Boosted. You should have enough minerals at ~7:20 to build a Twilight Council and start +1 Weapons.\n\nSit your Zealot/Sentry army at your natural and keep your Stalker active on the map. Make sure that you hold a watchtower and scout your opponent's front. If you do not see a Marauder by 8 minutes then get a Robotics Facility because they could be going for 2 Base Cloaked Banshees.\n\nThe Stalker is also important for scouting heavy Marine pressure. If this happens, take a few shots with the Stalker and then pull back to crush the Marines with Zealots, Force Fields and Guardian Shield. Assuming you haven't missed your warp-in cycles, and as long as you see it coming to get your Force Fields ready, you'll crush the push and take a huge lead. Despite only having 2 Gateways worth of production, 2 Gate Zealot production can defend 6 Rax Marine pressure with proper Sentry micro.\n\nWhen the Twilight Council finishes, build a Templar Archives and take your 4th Assimilator. Start Charge at 200 gas and Chrono Boost it twice. Start Psionic Storm with your next 200 gas and Chrono Boost it until completion. Spend any extra Chrono Boost on your Forge. Your next 450 gas will go towards 2 High Templar and +2 Armour. You will have Charge, Storm, 2 High Templar with 75 energy and 1/1 upgrades ~10:30 or earlier. This timing is very important because the 2 Medivac timing-attack that ~99% of Terran players go for after a gasless FE hits at ~10:30. If you have your Tech and upgrades done on time, and assuming decent control, you'll be able to crush the push solidly.\n\nNote that the spending between ~8 and ~10 minutes is very gas-heavy. This leaves you with a surplus of minerals which you will spend on Gateways and a third Nexus in some order. The safest way to do this is to drop the third Nexus after your additional Gateways have been started (you should go up to 6 Gateways in total), with your additional Gateways being started at around the same time you warp-in your 1st 2 High Templar. However, it is possible to take your third base before adding on Gateways or after adding on only two additional Gateways depending on how safe you feel and how close the third Nexus will be to your natural expansion.\n\nAfter you have 6 Gateways and your third Nexus started, build a Robotics Facilty when resources allow. After this, add 4 more Gateways for a total of 10. By about 13 minutes, you should be out on the map holding a central watch tower with 1 High Templar in each base for drop defense.

{"document": "# Warp Prism (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n\nThe Warp Prism is mostly seen in \"drop\" play, where it sneaks into the opponent's base and allows Zealots or Dark Templars to warp in and attack the opponent's workers.   Warp Prisms can also be an effective tool for reinforcing armies due to their \"deployable pylon\" ability, but usually less-expensive \"proxy\" Pylons, built near the front lines, serve that role.\n\nWarp Prisms are rarely seen until the later stage of most games due to fierce competition within the Robotics Facility in terms of what to build. Both the Immortal and Colossus are very powerful units which are essential in many situations throughout the game. Most Protoss units do not have any synergy with drop ships; Stalkers can blink up and down cliffs, Colossus can walk through cliffs, and Zealots/Archons/Dark Templar don't get any benefit from high ground. Prior to Patch 1.4, Warp Prisms were viewed as being far too fragile to use effectively, earning the nickname 'paper planes'. Warp Prisms are much hardier now at 80 HP and 100 shields, so their usage is nowhere near as much of a risk as it used to be.\n\nWhilst a speed upgrade does exist, it is usually a low priority upgrade compared to Blink or Extended Thermal Lances. As such, it is difficult to incorporate Warp Prisms into a stable strategy unless you are ahead in the game and can afford to skip a Colossus or see an opportunity to do a drop.\n\nA hallucinated Warp Prism can trick your opponent into retreating back into their base to defend.\n\nWith the extended pickup range, it is possible in Legacy of the Void to kite with a Warp Prism and a loaded unit such as an Immortal, allowing the controlling player to do damage while minimizing the damage the Warp Prism takes in the process. This involves the Warp Prism flying away from a chasing unit, unloading the attacking unit, clicking on the unit and then right-clicking on the Warp Prism before it flies 5 distance away from the attacking unit. This is a time window of just under 1.5 seconds, or just over 1.25 seconds with the Gravitic Drive upgrade. This is helpful for both a wounded Warp Prism that could otherwise be picked off with a few Blink Stalkers, or when pursuing fleeing units such as Roaches that are faster than the attacking unit but slower than the Warp Prism.", "question": "What ability of the Warp Prism can be used to reinforce armies effectively, but is usually replaced by less expensive proxy Pylons?", "options": ["Warp-in", "Deployable Pylon", "Hallucination", "Speed Upgrade"], "answer": "Deployable Pylon"}
{"document": "# Photon Cannon Rush\n## Execution\n### PvP and PvT\n\nIn general, a Photon Cannon rush consists of a Probe placing a hidden Pylon just outside the enemy's vision, and building additional Pylons and Photon Cannons closer and closer to the enemy's buildings and mineral line. Deciding when to send the first Probe is important as, above all else, the success of a Cannon Rush depends on the element of surprise. This means that any strange play early on may tip off the opponent that a Cannon Rush is imminent. It's generally recommended that a player send their first Probe after building their first Pylon, which is early enough to scout the opponent without hinting that a Cannon Rush is imminent.[1]\n\nOnce a player discovers the location of their opponent, a Forge should be immediately built.  Ideally, the initial Probe should go unseen and construct the first Pylon outside of the opponent's vision. If the opponent discovers this initial Probe, it may be beneficial to attempt to build the first Pylon in a location where cannons would have a greater effect, such as behind the mineral line.[1] Regardless of placement, the initial Pylon should be started before the Forge finishes to allow for the earliest possible rush. Once the Pylon finishes, the Forge should be complete, and the attacking player can begin building Cannons. If the rush is yet undetected, the initial Cannon should be placed near the initial Pylon to defend it; otherwise the Cannon should be placed to optimally engage defending forces. No Cannons should be allowed to be destroyed while constructing, any that are near death should be cancelled to recoup 75% of the mineral cost of construction.\n\nA typical adaptation of the Cannon Rush is to use Pylons to completely wall off Cannons behind the mineral line.[2] The idea is to make it impossible for the defending player to attack the Cannons with workers or melee units, while being able to completely deny mining in the main. The strategy works best on maps that have locations in the main that can be completely walled off using 3 or fewer Pylons, with good examples being Daybreak and Derelict Watcher.[3] In this adaptation, it's recommended that the attacking player save up 300 to 400 minerals to be able to build the blocking Pylons in quick succession, followed by the Cannons inside the wall once these initial Pylons complete. It's best to build the first Pylon in the location with the smallest gap.  At least one open hex should be left behind each Pylon so they can be quickly rebuilt if they are destroyed by melee units, which would otherwise prevent the Pylons from being rebuilt in the same location.\n\nThe success of a Cannon Rush depends greatly on the response of the opponent, often players will be caught off guard and either respond too harshly by sending all workers to attack the initial Pylon; or they respond too lightly, often by only sending one worker to attack the Probe building Cannons.[1][2]", "question": "What is the recommended action if the initial Probe is discovered during a Photon Cannon rush in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Cancel the rush and focus on economy", "Build the first Pylon in a location where cannons would have a greater effect", "Immediately build a Gateway and prepare to defend", "Send more Probes to distract the opponent"], "answer": "Build the first Pylon in a location where cannons would have a greater effect"}

{"document": "# 2 Gate FE 10-16 (vs. Zerg)\n## Notes\n### Early Game/Scouting\n\n- When you send your scouting Probe, first you should check for early pools so that you can prepare for a 6/7/8 pool or 11/12 pool. After this, you should check for gas timing. If you can keep the Probe around to see when they take their Extractor, you will know that Speed will not finish until 3 minutes after that. Using this, you can send the Probe back into their base slightly before that time to make sure everything is normal (taking their expansion, no early Roach Warren/Baneling Nest, take a look at their Drone count, etc.).\n\n- When hallucination finishes, make 2 hallucinated Phoenix, and check first for a third base, then their main and natural to see their choice of tech. Here are my responses to a few different choices from the Zerg:\n\n- Some type of all-in: Laugh at them and let your 2 Cannons crush their army. Do not waste force fields, make sure they are placed well. Against lings, do not let them up your ramp, and against Roaches, do not let them focus your Cannons down.\n\n- Against heavy Roach aggression, make additional Cannons as needed to prevent burrow antics, and make several Immortals before adding the Robotics Bay.\n\n- Against Nydus/doom drops/random cheesy strategies, use blink micro, add additional Gates as necessary. You should be able to see any of this stuff coming with hallucinate.\n\n- Early 3rd (i.e. started roughly between 6:00 and 7:00): This is usually defended by just Speedlings, though sometimes people with mix Banelings if they are doing some highly unorthodox strategy. Against this, chrono +1 and attack as soon as possible. With good force fields and +1 finishing during your attack, it should be nearly impossible for the Zerg to hold their third in this situation.\n\n- More Standard 3rd (i.e. started between about 8:00 and 9:00) : Usually this will be defended by Roach/Ling, though sometimes people try to get away with this 3rd timing while getting fast Infestors and using only lings to defend. Begin moving out to attack them at about 9:30 so that +1 and blink will be done by the time you arrive at their 3rd. Use hallucinated Phoenix to determine their army size and composition, and go for the kill/cancel if you feel it is possible. Otherwise, take whatever gains you can get and back retreat safely.\n\n- In general, if they are defending with Roach/Ling, you should be able to either force a cancel or kill the Hatchery if they started Lair tech. Zergs who have not begun a Lair, aka LosirA, will typically have enough Roaches to defend.\n\n- Delayed 3rd: This is becoming more common, and is seen in builds such as destiny's 2 base Infestor into a fast 3rd+4th. Against such fast Infestors, do not try to pressure the Zerg, as you will lose your whole army and cry.\n\n- In any case, you will want to add your Robotics Facility and 3-4 additional Gates as you move out, and in the cases when their third is defended well by Roach/ling or mass Speedling, take a third as soon as you feel safe.\n\n- Do not forget to continue harassing with blink Stalkers until they get Infestors out!", "question": "What is the recommended Protoss strategy against a Zerg that starts their third base between 8:00 and 9:00 in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Attack immediately with your entire army without using hallucinated Phoenix.", "Move out to attack around 9:30 with +1 and blink completed by the time you arrive.", "Wait until they expand to their fourth base before making any moves.", "Focus on building more Cannons and ignore their third base."], "answer": "Move out to attack around 9:30 with +1 and blink completed by the time you arrive."}

{"document": "# Zergling (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n\nZerglings are produced in every Zerg match-up.

It is critical for effective use of Zerglings: Zerglings attack by surrounding their victims, body-blocking them into place, and tearing them to shreds.

Further, it affords them the mobility for which they are known, making them effective scouts, rushers, sneak attackers, etc.\n\nThe Adrenal Glands upgrade is usually researched when Zerg reaches Hive if the Zerg has melee upgrades.

If your rush does not go detected, then do not build your Cannons as fast as possible; instead wait for the Hatchery to get to ~1000 Health before placing down your Cannons as this will prevent your Cannons from attacking before the Hatchery finishes (which would allow the Zerg to cancel the Hatchery). If the rush does go detected, immediately throw down Cannons and attempt to get the Zerg player to cancel their natural expansion. If they do cancel the expansion then cancel all but one of your Cannons and expand as normal.\n\nOn some maps, it is possible to rush both the natural and the third base of the Zerg from the same position.

{"document": "# Infestor (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nNeural Parasite is rarely used in this matchup because there are relatively few Zerg units worth controlling. The Ultralisk is immune to this ability (Frenzied). Enemy Infestors can be worth targeting, if only to deplete their energy.\n\nFungal Growth, however, is an important spell in ZvZ. Because Zerg armies consist of numerous mobile units, Fungal Growth's immobilization is devastating to the opposing army. Although players primarily use it against ranged units, it can also render melee units such as Zerglings and Banelings ineffective. Note that Fungal Growth does not one-shot either of them due to regeneration. Fungal Growth can also prevent units from unburrowing (including Ultralisks).\n\nIf enough Infestors have been built, it is possible to eliminate large clumps of Mutalisks by reapplying Fungal Growth five times, provided the Mutalisks are stacked. Done correctly, this can potentially allow the Infestor user to wipe out his opponent's air force without incurring a single loss, as Fungal Growth outranges Mutalisks. Similarly, it is possible to safely eliminate Mutalisks by combining Fungal Growth and Hydralisks, whose range also allows them to strike with impunity. In reaction to Infestors, a Mutalisk player should try to send in a few Mutalisks at a time to pick off Infestors before a large engagement; since Infestors are so gas-intensive, players will often very rarely have any anti-air accompanying them, forcing the Infestors to waste their energy.\n\nFungal Growth can also play a massive role in large Roach battles by damaging the opponent's Roaches and preventing them from achieving a good concave or burrowing to regenerate. This strategic advantage can cause enormous shifts in battles and is one of the most common units used in ZvZ. Because Roaches have a relatively short range, you can fungal them to clog up their lines so more of your Roaches than your opponent's can attack at once.\n\nMicrobial Shroud is nearly pointless to use in this matchup since the only common air unit in the mirror matchup is Mutalisks, and Fungal Growth can catch them up better. Mutalisks are unlikely to stick with the engagement for too long, and Microbial Shroud is a stationary spell, it is ill-advised to use the ability against them. Occasionally, even if Brood Lords do come to the field, they can spawn broodlings to overwhelm the units underneath the shroud.", "question": "In the Zerg versus Zerg matchup, what is the primary purpose of using Fungal Growth against Roaches?", "options": ["To increase the Roaches' attack range", "To immobilize and damage Roaches, preventing them from achieving a good concave", "To convert Roaches into a different unit type", "To heal friendly Roaches"], "answer": "To immobilize and damage Roaches, preventing them from achieving a good concave"}

{"document": "# Adept\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Zerg\n\n- When combined with an early wall-in, Adepts are effective at preventing early Zergling rushes due to their effectiveness against light armored units.\n\n- Adepts are used as a follow up scout after the Probe , this ensures that a Protoss player has the ability to see the Zerg player's plans by way of the shade ability. Using Psionic Transfer gives the Adept the ability to scout and/or escape any Lings attempting to kill the Adept. This would also allow the Protoss player to potentially inflict early game damage by killing a few Drones either by using the shade to dive into a mineral line or by using shade as an escape tool.\n\n- An early Adept push with Resonating Glaives, either rushed or after a Stargate opening, may do tremendous economic damage to the Zerg. In the case the build forces out Roaches, the Adepts should not commit to a straight up fight, but instead use their Shades to pressure the Zerg. This is because a follow up Roach counter-push is potentially deadly to the Protoss.\n\n- A mid game Gladept Immortal Sentry timing is another way to use Gladepts. The ranged nature of the Adept allows it to attack units that have been blocked by Force Fields.", "question": "What is the primary reason Adepts are effective against early Zergling rushes?", "options": ["Their ability to block the Zerglings with Force Fields", "Their high health points", "Their effectiveness against light armored units", "Their ability to cloak and avoid detection"], "answer": "Their effectiveness against light armored units"}
{"document": "# Raven (Legacy of the Void)\n## Spells\n\nRavens are equipped with an Build Auto-Turret, which creates an automated defense structure with 6 range (upgradable to 7 range with Hi-Sec Auto Tracking) that lasts for 10 seconds after deploying. The cast range for this ability is only 2, so using the Raven as a harassment tool is ill-advised. The Auto-Turret deals 18 damage at 0.57 cooldown which is 31.58 DPS. This makes the Auto-Turret a very cost-effective ability against small numbers of units or as additional damage support in an extended fight (such as during a push). It can also be used to wall off a ramp temporarily as it fills the same 2x2 area as a supply depot. The Auto-Turret can also be deployed on creep.  It can deal a maximum of 306 damage during its lifetime, excluding armor.\n\nThe Raven's second ability is Interference Matrix: a long-range castable missile that disables a unit's abilities and attacks but does not stop movement. The effect lasts for 11 seconds and is effective at disabling key units, much like BW Ghost's Lockdown. The ability costs 75 energy and is castable at 9 range. The Raven deploys the missile which will then rapidly accelerate towards the enemy, unescapable once casted. The ability is very effective when used against units such as Carriers and the Mothership or other high-priority units, (against Battlecruisers it disables Warp and Yamato). Moreover, if Matrix is used on an enemy transport it will be prevented from healing/transforming (as applicable), or loading/unloading units. Matrix is also highly effective against the Protoss Oracle. The Ability can only be cast against mechanical or psionic units.\n\nThe Raven's third ability is Anti-Armor Missile, which functions similarly to the old Seeker Missile. The missile immediately fires forward and pursues its target rapidly after it locks on. The missile can be dodged by loading the targeted unit into a structure, such as a Bunker or Nydus Worm/Canal, and by the use of teleporting abilities, such as Blink and Recall, though the missile will still detonate where the targeted unit was before it escaped. The Anti-Armor Missile inflicts no damage, but reduces armor and shield armor by 3 on all units within the blast radius. Armor is not capped at 0, so units with less than 3 armor will still take 3 additional damage per attack. The effects of multiple missiles do not stack. The ability costs 75 energy and is castable at 10 range though its pursuing distance can be extended to 18 range provided there is vision (such as through a scanner sweep). The missile is best complemented by units with low attack cooldowns such as stimmed Marines or Battlecruisers, but still has a significant impact alongside most attacking units.", "question": "What is the primary effect of the Interference Matrix ability when used against a mechanical or psionic unit in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It reduces the unit's armor by 3", "It deals 18 damage per second", "It disables the unit's abilities and attacks for 11 seconds", "It creates an automated defense structure"], "answer": "It disables the unit's abilities and attacks for 11 seconds"}

{"document": "# Mental Checklist\n## Daily #360 \"Mental Checklist: Exercises!\"\n### Zerg\n\nThe first and primary goal for Zerg are perfect Injects (spawn Larva). To hit an Inject right on time and have 0 energy afterwards is perfection, but if you have 3 or 5 it's totally fine. Your energy should stay below 40 at all times, if you train the MCL. Of course you sometimes need Transfusion, especially later in the game. But when it comes to training, stay below 40!\n\nEvery second your Hatches are not injected is a mistake. Play as efficient as possible! Keep your energy low!\n\nLet's take a look at the following Control Groups:\n\nKeep in mind \"The Backspace Trick\" is often used to inject. Therefore you could assign your control groups like this:\n\n- assign one Hatch to 3\n\n- assign all Hatches to 4\n\n- assign all Queens to 5\n\nWhile you are moving your Zerglings around, you hit 3 to check your injects.\n\nProgress bar is below 97%? Good. Move your army and hit 4 to check your Larva. No Larva? Good, back to your army.\n\nThe progress bar is at 97%? Use the \"Backspace Trick\" to inject all Hatches. If you prefer a different method, do it your way. Afterwards spend all your money, until no larva is left.\n\nMove your army and hit 3 to check your injects, move your army, hit 4 to check your larva. You have one larva? Build a unit! Your larva count always should display 0.\n\n97% is too slow for you? Try it with 99%. 97% ist too fast for you? Try it with 95% or 90%. Keep in mind the MCL is just a structural skeleton. Whatever works for you, to check your Injects and your larva is fine.\n\nNote: If checking a Hatch for Injects is too complicated, you can put all Queens on a Control Group and check the symbol for \"Larva inject\". If you have trouble keeping your energy low, you can add an additional Queen for Injects. E. g. you have three Hatcheries and four Queens. The fourth queen is able to do additional Injects.

{"document": "# 8 Marine SCV Rush\n\n8 Marine + SCV Rush\nStrategy Information\nCreator(s):Foxe\nR (April\nTerran Version)\nMatchups:TvT, TvP, TvZType:Opening\nPopularized by:Foxe\nR\n\n## Overview\n\nThis (almost always) all-in build allows for a hard hitting rush that usually catches opponents off guard. This build allows for a timed push and the ability to constantly stream in Marine and SCV reinforcements.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe objective of this build is to defeat your opponent in a single hit or damage his economy so severely that your opponent cannot continue. The pros of this build are that it allows for a fast win versus a greedy or teching opponent. The cons are that it is very usually all-in, and susceptible to Roach builds and fast tank/mech builds.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 7 SCV; 8 SCV; 9 Supply Depot @ 100 Minerals; Use SCV to scout after Supply Depot completion.; 10 SCV; 11 SCV; Build the 10 & 11 SCV during the building of the Supply Depot.; 11 Barracks @ 150 Minerals; 12 SCV; 13 SCV; Build the 12 & 13 SCV during the building of the Barracks.; 13 Barracks @ 150 Minerals; 14 Orbital Command; 15 Supply Depot (or around that time); If done correctly, you should be able to push out with 8 Marines at ~5 minutes into the game. |\n|  |\n\n- 7 SCV\n\n- 8 SCV\n\n- 9 Supply Depot @ 100 Minerals\n\n- Use SCV to scout after Supply Depot completion.\n\n- 10 SCV\n\n- 11 SCV\n\n- Build the 10 & 11 SCV during the building of the Supply Depot.\n\n- 11 Barracks @ 150 Minerals\n\n- 12 SCV\n\n- 13 SCV\n\n- Build the 12 & 13 SCV during the building of the Barracks.\n\n- 13 Barracks @ 150 Minerals\n\n- 14 Orbital Command\n\n- 15 Supply Depot (or around that time)\n\n- If done correctly, you should be able to push out with 8 Marines at ~5 minutes into the game.\n\n### Notes\n\nAfter the building of the first Barracks, immediately queue up a Marine and an Orbital Command. Remember to continuously build Marines from both Barracks and constantly use MULEs. After you build 8 Marines, hotkey them to a group, take all your SCVs off and hotkey them to a separate group (hit C to return cargo before you go), set your Barracks also on a hotkey with the rally to the enemy base. After all this is complete, start the assault while making sure that your SCVs are in the front so that they will tank for your Marines. Remember to continue calling down MULEs and producing Marines to reinforce your attack. After you take out your enemy's initial force, immediately attack their workers. If you feel that the push did not work, immediately reset your Barracks rally point and call back any units you have out. Be ready to switch into a standard mid-game build (preferably one with less teching) and start making SCVs.\n\n### Scouting\n\nWhen scouting after the initial Supply Depot, if against a Zerg, always check for 6-pool. It is recommended that you re-use your scout to check for Roaches (if you scout this, stop your attack, it will not work, trust me). If against Terran, check for fast Tanks (this could be a problem depending on when they get the Tank out), and if against Protoss, check for 2-gate Zealot pushes (usually you will be able to take this on).\n\n## Execution\n\nWell, after this build, hopefully you will not need a mid-game strategy, but in-case you go against Roaches, Tanks, or just mess up,  you should transition into a 4-Barracks build while keeping on the pressure. Hopefully you will have dealt some damage to your opponent so that they will be at least the same level as you economically.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nFor adaptations and what to do against certain unit mixes, please see the Execution and Scouting sections above.\n\n## Maps\n\nSteppes of War or preferably maps with short rush distance or 1v1 maps.\n\n### Pro features\n\nShort distance between bases and large ramps.\n\n### Con features\n\nLong distances between bases.", "question": "In the 8 Marine SCV Rush strategy, what is the primary objective of this build?", "options": ["To build a strong economy and outlast the opponent.", "To defeat the opponent in a single hit or severely damage their economy.", "To scout and gather information about the opponent's build order.", "To transition into a mid-game strategy with heavy teching."], "answer": "To defeat the opponent in a single hit or severely damage their economy."}

{"document": "# Dark Shrine (Legacy of the Void)\n\nDark Shrine\nBuilding Information\nCost: Minerals: 150  Vespene Gas: 150  Build Time: 71 → DDefense: Hit Points: 500  500  Armor: 1 Armored, Structure\nRequirements: Twilight Council\n Pylon Power\nUnlocked Tech: Dark Templar\n Archon\nUpgrades available: Shadow Stride\nSight:9\n\n- Twilight Council\n\n- Pylon Power\n\n- Dark Templar\n\n- Archon\n\n- Shadow Stride\n\n## Description\n\nThe Dark Shrine is a structure on the Protoss Technology Tree. Its only function is to unlock the powerful Dark Templar stealth melee unit at the Gateway and/or Warp Gate. The Dark Shrine requires a Twilight Council before it can be warped in.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Dark Shrine can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. However, if it loses access to the power field, even an unpowered Dark Shrine still allows the creation of Dark Templar, therefore the Dark Shrine only needs power to initiate its warping in.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\nDeciding between High Templar and Dark Templar is often a crucial distinction, especially in the mid-game transition. The Dark Shrine and Templar Archives are independent of each other and do not affect the other type of Templar. Therefore the Twilight Council can be considered a branching point of the tech tree, forcing players who are rushing Templar tech to choose between Dark Templar or High Templar; deploying both in the mid-game is virtually impossible due to the high cost in Vespene Gas of both structures and the units themselves. It also means that rushing Dark Templar takes away gas from more sturdy Robotics Facility or Stargate units. So it must be judged that the DT rush will do more damage than it costs, or the Protoss player may fall behind.\n\nThe Dark Templar is often used in surprise attacks, and for that reason, hiding the Dark Shrine from enemy scouting can be advantageous to a strategy that uses Dark Templar. However, this should not be relied upon to do damage; the mere diversion of resources to detection should be the focal point of the strategy. Regardless, in an early Dark Templar Rush, it is common that players will try to keep the Dark Templar obscured, this increases the chance that the opponent will delay or neglect to get detection, particularly until after the Dark Templar carry out their first attack. In late-game transitions to Dark Templar, the same desire for subterfuge often means that the Dark Shrine is built in an area unlikely to be scouted by the opponent such as a faraway base; due to the small size of a Dark Shrine, a Probe can easily sneak off into a remote location and build a Dark Shrine and Pylon with relatively low risk of being scouted. That being said, static detectors are more common in the late game, particularly towards 200-supply where they serve as a mineral dump, which reduces the effectiveness of a late game DT switch.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nShadow Stride Minerals: 100 Vespene Gas: 100 Build Time: 100\nResearched from: Dark Shrine\nAllows Dark Templars to teleport to nearby target location.", "question": "What is the primary function of the Dark Shrine in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To produce Dark Templar units", "To produce High Templar units", "To upgrade Dark Templar speed", "To increase Protoss army size"], "answer": "To produce Dark Templar units"}
{"document": "# General ZvT Strategy\n## Offense\n### Dealing with a Planetary Fortress\n\nIn general, it is not recommended to attack a Planetary Fortress head-on with your army.  Planetary Fortresses have 1500 hp and high armor (3, compared to a Command Center's 1) and have a very strong attack that also deals heavy splash damage.  In addition, it can be repaired, and unless the Terran player hasn't saturated the mineral line, there will always be many SCVs nearby to help repair.  Lastly, doing an Attack-Move command into a Planetary Fortress will cause all your units to target the Planetary Fortress and ignore the repairing SCVs.  You will have to manually tell your units to kill the repairing SCVs, which, depending on what units you are using, can cause overkill and pathing problems.\n\nThere are a few ways to deal with a Planetary Fortress:\n\n- Banelings - you'll need 20 Banelings to kill a Planetary Fortress (slightly less if you have range upgrades).  You should send 1-2 Zerglings slightly ahead of your Banelings so that the Planetary Fortress will shoot them instead of your Banelings.  In addition, you should first move your Banelings into the mineral line, so that when they detonate they also kill any mining SCVs there.  If you are ahead of your opponent on economy, then this is a good tactic, since it will instantly kill the base and any nearby SCVs without giving your opponent a chance to react.  However, if you are not ahead on economy, you need to be prepared for a counter-attack, since you just used 20 Banelings without killing any of the Terran army.\n\n- Mutalisks - since a Planetary Fortress cannot attack air units, this is the safest way to kill a Planetary Fortress; however almost all Terran players know this and build several Missile Turrets by their Planetary Fortress.  Thus, you must have enough Mutalisks to be able to kill the Turrets (even with repairing SCVs).  This will be your primary method of destroying Planetary Fortresses when using a Muta/Ling/Bane strategy.\n\n- Brood Lords - Since Brood Lords outrange Missile Turrets, they are even better than Mutalisks at destroying Planetary Fortresses cost-effectively.  However, since a large portion of their DPS comes from Broodlings, they are slower to kill the Planetary Fortress and nearby Turrets than Mutalisks are.\n\n- Using a combination of Zerglings and ranged units - by surrounding the Planetary Fortress with Zerglings you can prevent nearby SCVs from repairing it long enough to destroy it with the rest of your army.\n\n- Using Ultralisks - Ultralisks are specially equipped to deal with Planetary Fortresses.  They have extremely high DPS, and in addition they cause splash damage, so while attacking a Planetary Fortress they can also kill any nearby SCVs.  Lastly, they are big units, and so only a few of them can cover a large area around the Planetary Fortress and prevent SCVs from repairing it.", "question": "Which Zerg unit is specially equipped to deal with Planetary Fortresses due to its high DPS and splash damage, allowing it to kill nearby SCVs while attacking?", "options": ["Banelings", "Mutalisks", "Brood Lords", "Ultralisks"], "answer": "Ultralisks"}
{"document": "# Void Ray (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nCan be used in conjunction with Tempest and High Templar. Void Rays are an essential part of the Golden Armada lategame due to their high DPS. Combined with Archons and Storms, they help keep Corruptors at bay defending Carriers and allow Tempests to do their damage unopposed. Due to the common use of Immortal Archon Zealot in the midgame a transition into a Skytoss lategame requires throwing away Immortals, which contribute nothing when fighting Zerg flyers making Void Rays necessary to replace the anti armor bonus lost by sacrificing Immortals.\n\nSome players have also demonstrated that the Void Ray's massive DPS after activating Prismatic Alignment can be very useful in sniping key tech structure. sOs demonstrated that against a Roach centric mid game, six Void Rays can quickly snipe a Lair and the Mothership Core can use recall to bring them home, setting back the Zerg tech tree with virtually no losses.\n\nThe second usage of the Void Ray is in the early game against early Zerg cheese type attacks involving Roaches such as 19 Drone Roach Zergling. They are useful in this case as the absence of anti air is a weakness that can be exploited. The other is the low economy meaning the Zerg cannot spam enough roaches to ignore the voidray.

This reduces the attack damage done by the Mutalisk, but also, more significantly, it reduces the first bounce damage to 1 (2 with 3 attack upgrades) and the second to 0.5, effectively reducing 2+2+1 damage. This flat deduction actually gets worse in relation as the Glaives' upgrade effects do not match opposing defensive upgrades.\n\nThe natural Protoss counter to the Mutalisk is the Phoenix, that does extra damage versus Light units and is more mobile than the Mutalisk.

They will then be permanently mind controlled and does not use food. Due to the cooldown on this skill, you would generally only want to use it on big units (Ultralisks), not weak units (Zerglings).

{"document": "# Archon (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nTheir bonus against biological units makes Archons effective against all Zerg units. In fact, Archons can one-shot Zerglings and Banelings unless +1 carapace is researched. Conversely, this can be negated by the Protoss player researching additional tiers of Ground Weapons. An Archon with +3 weapons will also be able to 2-shot a Hydralisk with up to +1 carapace, in all other cases, an Archon will be able to 3-shot a Hydralisk.  With +2 carapace, a Hydralisk will be left with 1 HP after 2-shots from an Archon with +3 weapons due to HP regeneration. Archons are capable against Lurkers, but gas inefficient and may only be be able to effectively trade out in small numbers.\n\nIn this matchup Archons have many uses. They can be used to harass the opponent via Archon drops with a Warp Prism. Or they can be made en masse to counter comps that are heavy on Ling Bane. Note that without any upgrades it takes 18 (+ 1 as the Archon will instantly kill one of the banelings before they hit) banes to kill a single Archon.\n\nIn addition, they are very powerful against Mutalisks, dealing a quarter of their health per hit to everything in the splash area. Since Mutalisks tend to clump, this can be devastating. But this also makes them susceptible to Psionic Storm, which has much farther range, and most players prefer High Templars for this reason. Poorly controlled Corruptors will also be vulnerable for the same reason, with their armor bonus offering negligible resistance to the Archon's considerable damage.\n\nArchons splash can also be used to kill Creep Tumors without detection. Two attacks on a friendly unit close enough to the tumor will kill it.", "question": "How many attacks does an Archon with +3 weapons need to kill a Hydralisk with +1 carapace?", "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "answer": "2"}
{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Execution\n### Adaptations\n#### 2 Base Fast Infestor + Ling/Bling/Roach\n\nThe standard way of dealing with mass Infestors is to get tanks or Medivacs, while getting a fairly fast 3rd. Fast Infestors also means that the Zerg will have little to no Mutalisks, making Tanks a lot stronger. Upon scouting a fast Infestation Pit, you should immediately take all 4 gases and Double Fact (if your opponent hasn't already). This is followed by either a single or double Armory, depending on the player's commitment to mech.\n\nBecause of the delayed muta and that Infestors are relatively immobile, you can invest your minerals saved from turrets into another CC->PF to set up your 3rd. If timed properly, you should also be able to muster a strong tank push consisting of at least 8 tanks supported by ~60 Marines that can be mustered by 15–16 minutes, along with 1/1 infantry and 1/0 or 2/0 vehicle upgrades.\n\nAnother alternative is to invest in Ghosts as opposed to tanks.

It provides the Zerg player with Larvae as well as Creep covering an area of 8x6. Through Larvae and creep, Hatcheries give the ability to build all of the necessary Zerg units as well as the surface on which to create their buildings. Another important use that the Hatchery provides is the ability to create a Queen, which improves the Zerg's production capabilities as well as gives the Zerg player an early base defense. For  Minerals: 150  100, one can upgrade the Hatchery into a Lair. This upgrade takes  57.\n\nUpon being upgraded to Lair and subsequently into a Hive, a Hatchery will gain 500 health (for each upgrade).\n\nThe Hatchery offers two additional upgrades:\nBurrow allows most Zerg units the ability to burrow underground; burrowed units can only be attacked if a Detector unit has them in visual range or a Scanner Sweep is in effect in the area. Pneumatized Carapace increases Overlord and Overseer speed.\n\n### Macro Hatchery\n\nZerg players will often build an additional Hatchery inside an established base to assist with unit production. This \"macro Hatchery\", along with an extra Queen, provides extra Larva to help build units faster. This building is especially useful when a player is making macro mistakes (particularly: missing Spawn Larva timings) or when the army composition is Larva-heavy, such as one that depends on Zerglings.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nBurrow Minerals: 100 100 71\nResearched from: Hatchery\nEnables all Zerg ground units to use the Burrow ability. Burrow allows a unit to take cover underground, rendering it unable to attack. A burrowed unit is invisible unless revealed by detectors or effects.\n\nPneumatized Carapace Minerals: 100 100 43\nResearched from: Hatchery\nIncreases the movement speed of Overlords to 3.00 and Overseers to 4.72.\n\nWith Legacy of the Void, the Ventral Sacs upgrade has been moved to individual Overlords.", "question": "What upgrade, researched from the Hatchery, allows most Zerg units to burrow underground?", "options": ["Pneumatized Carapace", "Burrow", "Ventral Sacs", "Spore Crawler"], "answer": "Burrow"}
{"document": "# Changeling (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n\nThe Changeling is most often used to keep track of the opponent's main army, and is usually ordered to follow one of the enemy units (preferably of the same kind). You then get constant updates on the composition and position of their army, so that making unit counters, flanking and harassment are all much easier. These are very effective scouts against an uninformed opponent.\n\nChangelings are also good for gaining temporary control over a Xel'Naga Tower as they do not cost any supply.\n\nIt is possible to create a pseudo Force Field using a group of Changelings to block off a ramp. By using multiple Overseers, it is possible to spawn a large mass of Changelings. Putting these on a ramp on Hold will require the enemy to manually target all the Changelings.

{"document": "# Thor (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### In General\n\nThe Thor's high health and ability to be repaired by SCVs make Thors difficult to kill. Like the Marauder Thors serve as an anchor on the battlefield for fast but low health units, which can retreat behind these anchors to avoid splash damage or sniping tactics.\n\nThe Thor is primarily used as an anti-Mutalisk unit for its +Light splash damage.  With its Explosive Payload anti-air attack, it outranges the opponent to spread their air units or suffer large amounts of splash damage. One of the advantages of flying units is that they have no unit collision, and can stack on top of each other for maximum DPS density and forcing the opponent to spread out their air units manually before engaging (called Magic Boxing).\n\nIn contrast with the aerial mobility and anti-ground damage of Liberators, which are better suited to the drop harassment style of Terran Bio and Medivacs. Thors are better suited to the hold the line/range advantage given by Siege Tanks and Cyclones; can also be made in a pinch (even without any upgrades) to support Vikings or Ghosts to engage Broodlords, Disruptors, or any other Capital Ships directly with High Impact Payload and high health tankiness.\n\nA increasingly common strategy for terrans is Double Thor Drop play, where the mech terran opts for two Medivacs and two Thors to harass with in the mid game. This offsets the normally immobile Thor at the expense of the Medivacs fragility. It is capable of sniping tech structures and bases (particularly against greedy Zergs).", "question": "What is one of the primary roles of the Thor in StarCraft II battles?", "options": ["To serve as a fast-moving scout", "To act as an anti-Mutalisk unit with its +Light splash damage", "To provide long-range sniping support", "To serve as a mobile repair unit"], "answer": "To act as an anti-Mutalisk unit with its +Light splash damage"}

This effect wears off after 11 seconds. Note that while casting stimpack again when it is already in effect will not further increase firing rate or movement speed, it will however refresh the effect's duration at the cost of additional health loss.\n\n## Use\n\nThe Stimpack ability is perhaps the most important upgrade one can research for a Terran bio army. The loss of 10/20 hp per unit is negligible compared to the immense advantage of superior damage output. The speed also allows units to form a concave faster which further increases the firepower. As a general rule, you'll want to stim just prior to engaging in any battle, but the ability has many situational uses.\n\n1) Stimming for power - Besides using it in a battle, stim is useful to ward off harassing enemy air units. Do not do this prematurely, as enemy air units such as Mutalisks will sometimes simply fly towards you and retreat once you have stimmed, costing your units health at no damage to the enemy. Stim is also used to speed up the removal of destructible rocks.\n\n2) Stimming for speed - If your infantry has a long way to go and you have Medivacs available, stim can be used to speed up your army. This is important in critical situations such as a surprise timing push or an enemy drop in your base. Stim is also useful for sniping off retreating units. The speed is particularly effective in conjunction with Marauders and Concussive Shells since your retreating opponent will also be slowed.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\n- By utilizing Stimpack in conjunction with Heal from the Medivac, the stim ability can be used more often since the health cost is countered. However, it is important to balance the use of stim with the amount of energy that the Medivacs have on reserve. Depending on how many Medivacs you have, if you overuse stim you will not have any energy left for healing during a larger battle.\n\n- Researching Combat Shield adds +10 HP to Marines, this effectively negates the 10 HP loss when using Stimpack.\n\n## Other\n\n- When used, a green lightning bolt will flash over the stimmed units. When the Stimpack buff ends, a red lightning bolt will appear.\n\n- You can never kill the unit itself by using Stimpack\n\n## Notes", "question": "What is the primary effect of using the Stimpack ability on a Marine or Marauder in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It increases their armor by 50%", "It increases their movement speed and firing rate by 50%", "It increases their health by 50%", "It increases their attack range by 50%"], "answer": "It increases their movement speed and firing rate by 50%"}

Time Warp reduces the movement and attack speed of all enemy units and structures within the target area by 50%. Upon casting, the Time Warp area will be displayed on the map and activate after 1.79 seconds, and then the Time Warp effct will last for 7 seconds.\n\n## Use\n\nIn competitive play Time Warp is usually used to prevent enemy forces from microing or escaping the Protoss player's units, particularly Zealots. Sometimes Time Warp will be used to escape from enemy units, but Mass Recall or Strategic Recall is usually preferred. Additionally, since Time Warp slows down enemy workers, it can be used as a form of harassment.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nDue to the nature of mirror matchups, Time Warp is particularly useful for its ability to minimize the effectiveness of enemy micro. Against Zealots without Charge, Time Warp can sometimes prevent said Zealots from attacking at all. However, Blink Stalkers can still be used effectively, so it is unwise to rely on Time Warp against Twilight Council play.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nTime Warps can be used extremely well against Terran Bio. They negate the increased movement speed of stimmed units, which prevents the kiting of Zealots often relied on by Terran players. In situations against Hellbats, Time Warp is significantly less useful because Zealots are not as cost-efficient. Still, attacks from Colossi are much harder to dodge under Time Warps, so the spell is far from useless.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nTime Warp can more than nullify the movement speed increase that Zerg units have on creep. Like Terran, many Zerg units rely on speed to get up close to their enemies for maximum damage output, thus Time Warp can be used to great effect. Its usefulness is very broad; Zerglings and Roaches in particular deal much less damage as a result of their speed decrease.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\n- Multiple Time Warps do not stack the speed decrease.\n\n- Using Force Field and Time Warp together inhibits the enemy units' movement even more.\n\n- Psi Storm is extremely deadly against units under the effect of Time Warp.\n\n## Other\n\n- Does not affect friendly units", "question": "What is the primary effect of Time Warp when cast by the Protoss Mothership?", "options": ["Increases the movement speed of enemy units", "Reduces the movement and attack speed of enemy units by 50%", "Heals friendly units within the area", "Creates a barrier that blocks enemy projectiles"], "answer": "Reduces the movement and attack speed of enemy units by 50%"}

{"document": "# High Templar (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nBecause of the tendency for armies to clump together when moved en masse, large Marine/Marauder groups can be devastated with properly placed Psionic Storms. A Ghost's EMP can nullify a High Templar, leaving it vulnerable to be picked off by the opposing forces, though this can be counteracted by using the Feedback ability on the Ghost before EMP is cast. Feedback can also be useful on Medivacs to prevent them from healing Terran infantry units - this being especially effective when defending against impending drops when the Medivacs' energy level is the highest, possibly high enough to be lethal.\n\nIn the current way the game is played, the effectiveness of High Templar in Protoss vs Terran is highly dependent on the Protoss player’s control.  Even after the removal of the Khaydarin Amulet upgrade, Psionic Storm remains an invaluable weapon against Terran bio, and a necessary tech switch against Viking heavy compositions.  Now that Protoss players can not warp in Storms at will, they are forced to keep High Templar in their standing army as well as protect and control them carefully.  A number of techniques for using and controlling High Templar efficiently emerged.\n\nThe first instinct of Protoss players was to have one High Templar step forward at a time to storm or feedback in hopes that the Terran player would waste an EMP on a single Templar or be hit by the Storm if he didn’t react quickly enough.  Terran players proved too attentive to fall victim to the storm and used the Ghost’s Snipe ability or lone Marauders to pick off the Templar.\n\nNaNiwa took a different approach and separated his Templar from his main army until his Stalkers, Zealots, and Colossus had absorbed all the EMPs.  He would bring his Templar to the front to Storm while his main army retreated after the Ghosts had exhausted all their energy.  However, the best this method could hope for was an even trade.  If the Ghosts had even a few EMPs left when the templars moved up, the Templar could be wiped out easily.\n\nThe dominant methods of Templar control are the most difficult to pull off but also the most rewarding.  Top players keep their Templar spread out at all times when not in battle, and try to keep them from clumping up as they engage.  Many players store Templar in a Warp Prism and drop them in a line as the battle begins. The Templar are already spread out upon emerging from a moving warp prism and they are easier to position this way. However, the warp prism must be protected from Vikings at all costs.", "question": "What is a recommended strategy for protecting High Templar from EMPs in Protoss vs. Terran matches?", "options": ["Deploy High Templar in the front line to absorb EMPs first", "Use a Warp Prism to drop High Templar in a spread-out formation", "Keep High Templar hidden in a base until the end of the game", "Always move High Templar with Stalkers and Zealots to share damage"], "answer": "Use a Warp Prism to drop High Templar in a spread-out formation"}

{"document": "# 2 Gate Fast Expand (vs. Protoss)\n## Basic Build Order\n\nThis particular build revolves around getting a Sentry first, followed by two Stalkers, followed by two Sentries. This order of units is safe against virtually any early pressure. The combination of an early Sentry and the Mothership Core gives you access to early Force Fields and Photon Overcharge, through which you can buy enough time to get a more proper response up against any early pressure. The follow up Stalkers and Sentries further reinforce your defensive strength and allow you to take an early Nexus while neglecting to scout your opponent's main base until 6:00 with a Hallucination.\n\nThis build is safe against most early pressure; as such, there is no need to scout the opponent's main base quickly. There are, however, certain precautions you do need to have. After you build your first Gateway, you need to scout around your main base and natural for proxies. If you scout a proxy 2 Gate Zealot Rush, a proxy 2 Gate Stalker Rush or a Photon Cannon Rush, drop the build immediately and defend appropriately.\n\nWhen your Sentry pops out (~4:15), you want to send a Probe scout in the opposite direction of your Mothership Core to scout the outskirts of the map for proxies. It's important to keep this Probe hidden on the map after scouting in order to build proxy Pylons in case you get contained or plan on aggressively counter-attacking. This dual MSC/Probe scout should alert you to anything like a proxy Stargate or an early hidden Pylon and will allow you to react accordingly. During this time, your Sentry should be poised to get as much vision in front of your ramp as possible in order to spot early Zealots trying to run into your main.\n\nDuring this time, you should be thinking about things like:\n\n- Is my opponent going for some kind of Warpgate rush?\n\n- Is my opponent trying to proxy a Stargate?\n\n- Is my opponent trying to hide a Twilight Council/Dark Shrine?\n\n- If I don't see anything, is my opponent fast expanding?\n\n| Two Gate FE |\n| --- |\n| 9 Pylon[1]; 13 Gateway; 15 Double Assimilator[2]; 17 Pylon; 18 Cybernetics Core; 20 Gateway; 21 Warpgate; 23 Sentry; 25 Mothership Core[3]; 25 Pylon[4]; @100% Sentry: 2x Stalker[5]; 31 Pylon; @100% Stalkers: 2x Sentry; 38/42 Cut Probe Production; 38 Nexus[6]; 38 Robotics Facility; @ ~6:00: Send Hallucination Scout; 38 Proxy Pylon; 100% Warpgate Research: 2x Stalker; 42 Gate; Resume Probe Production |\n| ↑ Chrono Boost Probes three times when this Pylon finishes.; ; ↑ Mine both gases with 3 Probes once they complete.; ; ↑ Chrono Boost your Mothership Core, and then use it to scout around your base.; ; ↑ Send this Probe out to scout for hidden Stargates etc. and then hide it out on the map.; ; ↑ Chrono Boost both Stalkers.; ; ↑ You will only build this if it is safe to do so.

It was a ladder map until October 7, 2010 and was used in the GSL.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nDestroy rocks to gain access to easily defended resources. Watch Towers overlook the central battlefield. Destroy rocks to open up paths on the top and bottom of the map.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Rush Distance - The rush distance between bases greatly depends on spawning points. Timing is significantly different between vertical, cross-positions, and horizontal spawns.\n\n- Main Choke - The choke point between the main and natural is very thin, and can be walled with just two buildings.\n\n- 2nd Natural - The secondary natural is guarded by rocks on both sides.[1]\n\n- 'Cliffable' High-Ground - here is high ground close to the mineral line at the natural, allowing for economic harass. The high ground behind the two high yield expansions are also tankable.\n\n- Destructible Rocks - Unless the destructible rocks at the top and bottom of the map are destroyed, ground units crossing from one side of the map to the other have to funnel through the central choke point.\n\n- Xel'Naga Towers - The two central Xel'Naga Towers give vision of all of the main choke points and ground unit routes on the map.\n\n- Natural Expansions - The natural expansions are very vulnerable due to the fact that they have 2 main entrances and 1 additional entrance if the rocks are destroyed.\n\n## Protoss Wall-ins\n\nNote: By sacrificing a Pylon, a Protoss can copy all Terran wall-ins by replacing the Supply Depot with a Pylon and the Barracks with a Gateway. This may be useful in PvP for preventing all Zealot rushes.\n\n## Terran wall-ins\n\n- 10 o'clock\n\n10 o'clock\n\n- 2 o'clock\n\n2 o'clock\n\n- 5 o'clock\n\n5 o'clock\n\n- 7 o'clock\n\n7 o'clock\n\n## Notable Games\n\n- FruitDealer vs TOP, GSL Open S1 Ro16, 3set - When most Zerg players vetoed the map, FruitDealer demonstrated the potential of lategame.\n\n- IdrA vs Nazgul, 2010 MLG Dallas, 3set - Nazgul utilizes the features of the map to full effect with a Blink Stalker build.\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Kulas Ravine42148657.1%660100.0%1651131.2%33-\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Kulas Ravine | 42 | 14 | 8 | 6 | 57.1% | 6 | 6 | 0 | 100.0% | 16 | 5 | 11 | 31.2% | 3 | 3 | - |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2010-11-052010-11-072010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas2010-08-282010-10-022010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 12010-08-182010-08-22\nIEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010-11-05 | 2010-11-07 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas |\n| 2010-08-28 | 2010-10-02 |  | 2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1 |\n| 2010-08-18 | 2010-08-22 |  | IEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne |", "question": "Which of the following best describes the main choke point on Kulas Ravine?", "options": ["It is wide and easily passable by multiple units.", "It can be walled off with just two buildings.", "It is protected by indestructible rocks.", "It is located far from the main base."], "answer": "It can be walled off with just two buildings."}

{"document": "# Cyclone\n## Competitive Use\n\n- Since patch 5.0.12 Cyclones are again buildable from a reactored factory and they are debateably stronger early game due to the Lock On cooldown removal and, because of their anti-mech bonus, cyclones are still good options against early harassing units such as Medivacs, Banshees, Oracles or Warp Prisms.\n\n- Cyclones lose their mobility advantage against fast mass-produced units and upgrades like Stimpacked Marine/Marauder, Zerglings with Metabolic Boost or Blink Stalkers because their speed has been reduced.\n\n- Lock On now only has a maximum effective range of 9, far lower than it was before (15). While the Cyclone is still able to snipe off key units from a safe distance after achieving Lock On, it is easier for its target to escape from Lock On's maximum range.\n\n- Lock On only has 6 casting range however so care must be taken to ensure the Cyclone survives to unleash its full volley due to its limited 110 hit points (a single widow mine one-shots a Cyclone).

{"document": "# Delta Quadrant\n\nDelta Quadrant\nMap Information\nCreator:Blizzard Entertainment\nTileset:Avernus\nSize:160x140\nSpawn Positions:4 at 1,4,7,10\nVersions:1.21v1 Ladder:2010-07-27 — 2011-07-26\n\n## Overview\n\nDelta Quadrant is a 4 player map released with the StarCraft II Launch. It is intended for 1v1 or FFA play and was in the Blizzard ladder during seasons 1 and 2.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nTwo natural expansions are available. One is hidden behind your base, but a rock must be destroyed for optimal resource harvesting. The other expansion is located on the main attack path but available immediately. Choose your first expansion wisely!\n\n## Notable Features\n\nDelta Quadrant is one of the few SC2 competitive maps that has a back door expansion. This allows for turtle-heavy styles that are impossible on most maps.\nThe main vulnerability of the back door expansion is its vulnerability to drops. It has a very wide edge circumference, and also has a ledge above it on which you can drop units.\n\n- Protoss players can warp in units into the back door expansion by placing a pylon at the edge behind the vespene geyser of the natural expansion.\n\nDespite the very large number of expansion locations on Delta Quadrant, there are rocks blocking most of them.  This, combined with the very short rush distances, makes the map generally unsuitable for macro games.\n\n- Delta Quadrant is characterized by rotational symmetry. The natural expansion of Player 1, spawning at the 10 o'clock position, is more susceptible to attacks than the natural of Player 2, spawning at the 2 o'clock position. For this reason, Delta Quadrant is rarely used in tournament play.\n\n## Trivia\n\nThe show Star Trek: Voyager was about a Starfleet ship lost in the Delta Quadrant.\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Delta Quadrant21138211755.3%21101147.6%78304838.5%234110\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Delta Quadrant | 211 | 38 | 21 | 17 | 55.3% | 21 | 10 | 11 | 47.6% | 78 | 30 | 48 | 38.5% | 23 | 41 | 10 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2011-01-122011-03-20\nGosu\nCoaching Premiere League Season 12011-01-022011-01-292011 Sony Ericsson Global StarCraft II League January2010-11-152010-12-182010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 32010-11-252010-11-27\nDream\nHack Steel\nSeries LAN2010-10-092010-11-132010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 22010-11-052010-11-072010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas2010-10-152010-10-162010 MLG Pro Circuit Washington D.C.2010-08-282010-10-022010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 12010-08-272010-08-282010 MLG Pro Circuit Raleigh2010-08-182010-08-22\nIEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011-01-12 | 2011-03-20 |  | GosuCoaching Premiere League Season 1 |\n| 2011-01-02 | 2011-01-29 |  | 2011 Sony Ericsson Global StarCraft II League January |\n| 2010-11-15 | 2010-12-18 |  | 2010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 3 |\n| 2010-11-25 | 2010-11-27 |  | DreamHack SteelSeries LAN |\n| 2010-10-09 | 2010-11-13 |  | 2010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 2 |\n| 2010-11-05 | 2010-11-07 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas |\n| 2010-10-15 | 2010-10-16 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Washington D.C. |\n| 2010-08-28 | 2010-10-02 |  | 2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1 |\n| 2010-08-27 | 2010-08-28 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Raleigh |\n| 2010-08-18 | 2010-08-22 |  | IEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne |", "question": "Which race can warp in units into the back door expansion on the Delta Quadrant map?", "options": ["Terran", "Zerg", "Protoss", "None of the above"], "answer": "Protoss"}

It is similar to a slightly weaker Zergling, but has a limited lifetime, after which it will die regardless of health. It lives for 5.71 seconds when spawned from dead buildings and 3.57 seconds when spawned from Brood Lords.\n\nMost Zerg buildings produce six Broodlings on death. The exceptions are Hatcheries, Lairs, and Hives, which produce nine, and Spine Crawlers, Spore Crawlers, and Extractors, which do not produce any Broodlings. Brood Lords attack by launching Broodlings at their targets, spawning one Broodling per attack. Note that if a Brood Lord does not attack for some time, it will attack twice on its first volley afterwards.\n\nThe Broodling profits from both Melee Attacks and Ground Carapace upgrades.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nThe Broodling can be used against the Protoss Zealot/Stalker/Colossi Death Ball much as it is used against the Terran Bio Ball, scrambling units movement and causing the AI to target the Broodlings over higher damage ranged units. This is much less effective after the Protoss have researched the Blink upgrade as they can blink their Stalker directly underneath the slow moving Broodlord and easily snipe it, removing the stream of Broodlings.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nWhen spawned from its creator, the Brood Lord, it creates a unit that blocks the \"Terran Ball\" and distracts/scrambles the AI of the attacking Terran, making it much harder to run in back to kill the Broodlords. Broodlings also cause the Tanks in the army to splash them and whatever the Broodlings are attacking, making them very annoying for a heavy Tank army to take on.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nWith the predominance of Roach/Hydralisk and Roach/Infestor compositions, the Broodling, when created from a Brood Lord, is able to scramble the movement of the Roaches and thus disallowing the slow Hydralisks from hitting Brood Lords.", "question": "How many Broodlings are produced when a Hatchery, Lair, or Hive is destroyed?", "options": ["3", "6", "9", "12"], "answer": "9"}

{"document": "# Battle.net Leagues\n## League Descriptions\n### Practice League\n\nThe Practice League no longer exists in the game, but was available early on in Wings of Liberty. The Practice League was separate from the rest of the ladder, which allowed new players to practice multiplayer matches prior to their placement matches. Practice league was completely optional. Players could conduct up to 50 matches in Practice league, which used a special \"novice version\" of the ladder maps. The novice versions differed from the standard version as they included additional destructible rocks in rushing paths to slow the game down. This provided early game protection for newer players, which afforded them time to explore and learn both the interface and game. Additionally, the game speed in Practice League was \"Normal\" instead of \"Faster\".

See Game Speed.\n\n- Cybernetics Core\n\n## Description\n\nThe Stasis Orb was a Protoss alpha hovering unit introduced during BlizzCon 2007. It was meant to replace the Star Relic but was nothing close to its predecessor. It originally possessed a single, passive ability, slowing down movement and fire-rate of the enemies it attacked. When its only ability got transferred over to the Terran Cobra prospects looked grim for the lacking unit. The devs made a short-lived attempt at reviving the Orb, trying out several active abilities, including Force Fields. Only two months after its introduction the Stasis Orb got removed from the game completely while Blizzard promised to promptly replace it with something better. This successor turned out to be the Nullifier.\n\n## Spells\n\nForce Field\nCaster: Stasis Orb 30\nDuration: 15\nRadius: 1.7\nBarrier that lasts 15 seconds and impedes movement of ground units.\n\n## Notes\n\n- Introduced in August 2007 and cut in October the same year.[1]\n\n- The Stasis Orb was originally meant to have no active abilities.\n\n- It replaced the Star Relic but soon got replaced itself by the Nullifier.\n\n- Quite a few traits of its final evolution was first seen in the Stasis Orb, including its force fields and hovering movement.\n\n- The Oracle's model is based on the Stasis Orb design.[2]", "question": "Which ability was briefly considered for the Stasis Orb before it was removed from the game?", "options": ["Teleportation", "Force Fields", "Invisibility Cloak", "Healing Beam"], "answer": "Force Fields"}

This 3 Gate times out surprisingly smoothly and can be used for either defense (against an aggressive 2 Rax opening or something of that ilk) or offense (against a more passive Marauder expand). The second Zealot (started at 32 supply), the second Gateway and Warpgate Research all finish at ~5:50. Convert the Gateways to Warpgates and warp-in 2 units at ~6:00. The third Gateway then finishes at ~6:25 and is a Warpgate at ~6:35, which lines up perfectly for a 3 unit warp-in at ~6:35. This gives you 9 Gateway units by ~6:40 which is 100% guaranteed to be stronger than whatever Terran can have at your base by this time.\n\nThe only thing that can give you trouble is if you let Terran get Bunkers down before ~6:40. A Bunker takes 40 seconds to complete and most Terran pressure will not hit your base until ~6:10 or later so you'll have plenty of time to clean up with either your 6 unit timing at ~6:10 or your 9 unit timing at ~6:40. Just make sure to be aware of any sneaky SCVs trying to build a hidden Bunker near your Nexus preemptively.

Alternatively, if you think that your opponent is expanding behind their pressure, you can add 2-4 (5-7 total) more Gateways and go for a Gateway counter-attack.

After a brief initialisation phase after placement, the structure automatically burrows and begins generating creep. The Creep Tumor must be placed on existing creep, and will generate new creep in a 10 square radius around itself. Upon burrowing, each Creep Tumor has the ability to create one additional tumor in a 10 square radius anywhere on the creep in sight and then lose the ability permanently. Creep generation increases with every building emplacing creep.\n\nCreep Tumors do not count as structures for the purpose of losing a game (by losing all structures), but they do count for Stalemate Detection[1].\n\n## Abilities\n\nSpawn Creep Tumor\nCaster: Queen, Creep Tumor 25\nRange: 1\nDuration: 11 s\nThe Queen moves to and places a Creep Tumor at the targeted location. The tumor has 50 hit points and generates Creep. Each Creep Tumor can spawn one other Creep Tumor within a radius of 10.\n\nAfter using this ability, the physical appearance of the original Creep Tumor will change; appearing darker overall.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\nBecause creep greatly increases the movement speed of many Zerg units, Creep Tumors are primarily used to create Creep 'highways' between expansions for faster reinforcements. Creep Tumors may also be extended out into the center of the map in the mid and late game to allow Zerg units to move across the map more quickly and engage enemies with greater speed. They also provide a large radius of sight, greatly enchancing the speed upon which raids can be reacted to upon the area they cover.\n\nAs long as one tumor that has not used its ability remains on the map, Zerg can continue creating new Creep Tumors and spreading creep indefinitely. It is advisable to avoid losing these 'active' tumors to enemy attack, as doing so can significantly slow Zerg's ability to spread creep and requires that additional 25 points of Queen energy be spent to generate a new tumor.\n\nCreep Tumors can also be used in conjunction with the Overlord's Generate Creep ability or a Nydus Worm to create areas of creep not connected to a Zerg base. Using a Queen to place the tumor on the initial creep generated by these units will keep the creep from disappearing, even if the Nydus Worm is killed or the Overlord ceases dropping creep. Possible uses for this non-contiguous creep may be establishing a defensive position or for certain offensive strategies such as a Spine Crawler attack.\n\nInstead of using an Overlord (requires Lair) to Generate Creep, morphing a Drone into a Hatchery then canceling the Hatchery and immediately placing a Creep Tumor on the creep left by the cancelled Hatchery will work. This technique is usually for offensive Spine Crawler pushes.\n\n#### Counter Strategies\n\nAll Creep Tumors are permanently burrowed once complete, meaning that opponents cannot see or target them unless the Creep Tumor is within the sight range of a Detector unit. It is advisable for Terran and Protoss players attacking a Zerg player to include a Detector unit in their army or use scans to destroy Creep Tumors; thereby removing both creep and the vision the Tumors provide from the map.\n\n## See Also\n\n- Creep\n\n- Spawn Creep Tumor", "question": "What is the primary purpose of Creep Tumors in competitive StarCraft II gameplay?", "options": ["To increase the hit points of Zerg units", "To create Creep 'highways' for faster unit movement", "To provide additional resources for Zerg players", "To serve as a defensive structure against enemy attacks"], "answer": "To create Creep 'highways' for faster unit movement"}
{"document": "# Mental Checklist\n## Daily #132 \"Back to the Basics: The Mental Checklist\"\n\nDay[9] explains basic mechanics like assigning Control Groups and using Shift.\n\nThe simplest way to execute the MCL is training only one part of it. You should forget about things like\n\n- Build Order\n\n- strategy\n\nand so on. You just check your production. After your checking, comes the reaction on your check.\n\nYour worker is at 80%, build the next one!\n\nYour unit (Marine, Zealot) is at 80%, build the next one!\n\nIf you want to make it more difficult, try to execute a simple 1Base-Build like 111 or 4Gate or 7RR.\n\nProtoss need to train a Macro cycle called \"Warp-In Drill\"[2]:\n\n- Warp-In units\n\n- Control Group\n\n- Chrono Boost\n\n- Build Pylons\n\nControl Group: Select all units and use Shift + 1 or whatever you use as \"Army Hotkey\". E.g. you have 9 Zealots in Control Group 1. You warp in 6 Stalker, use Shift + 1 to add those Stalker to your Control Group. You use Chrono Boost on your Forge and your Robo and you build 2 Pylons, because you have 2 bases.\n\nIf you are able to do this for a complete game, which lasts more than 20 minutes, then you can take the next step.\n\nYour Immortal is at 95%, build the next one!\n\nOne of the most important things Day9 says in his daily: Do not click on your Nexus! Use 4 and E instead.

{"document": "# +1 4 Gate Stargate Third (vs. Zerg)\n## Scouting\n\nThis build does not depend heavily upon scouting as the aggression utilised within this build should force the Zerg player into certain Tech and timing avenues (analogous to MarineKing's Aggro-Style in TvZ[1]). However, as with any build, unscouted all-ins(particularly 1 base allins) can still pose a threat.\n\nThe most important pieces of scouting information are finding/verifying expansions and discerning the choice of Lair Tech from the Zerg player.\n\nAs described by the opening, a probe should be sent to scout for the Zerg's location after the Nexus is placed down. 10 Pool Speedling All-in is particularly scary, and requires immediate reaction(either walling the natural with a cannon or retreating to the main). A 1 Base Baneling All-in is even scarier, and requires a complete probe cut, hastily constructed wall with 2 cannons, fully chronoboosted Zealot production and a probe pull.\n\nAlso important is the gas timing. If the Zerg has no gas they are going for 3 Hatch Before Gas. If the Zerg mines only 100 gas(which can be determined by clicking on the gas and seeing how much remains) they are planning to defend 3 bases with relatively early speedlings.\n\nIf the Zerg mines over 100 gas there are many options available, depending on whether they have a third or not. If they do have a third they will likely be doing Ling/Baneling to defend the midgame timing attack, planning to control the map with midgame Roaches, or they will be trying to Tech up relatively quickly. The Roaches will be shooed away by the Void Ray. The Tech will be too late to be helpful for the timing attack, but could prove to be a problem further on in the game, particularly when trying to establish the third. If they do not have a third they will likely be doing either 2 Base Mutalisks or 2 Base Hydralisk All-in, both of which are covered in the Variant section.\n\nFor more detailed information on scouting with the opening, see: Gate_Nexus_YufFE#Scouting.", "question": "What is a critical piece of information to scout for when using the +1 4 Gate Stargate Third build against Zerg?", "options": ["The Zerg player's choice of Terran unit", "The Zerg player's gas timing", "The Zerg player's base location", "The Zerg player's Protoss unit"], "answer": "The Zerg player's gas timing"}

{"document": "# Viper (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\nVipers can be of great use against a Terran employing either a mechanical or a Marine-Tank army composition. Blinding Cloud is especially useful against Siege Tanks, as the tanks must un-siege in order to move out of the cloud, effectively removing them from the battle. Blinding Cloud can also be used against clumps of Marines and Marauders, zoning them out of choke points and making them easier to hit with Banelings and Fungal Growth. The Viper's Abduct ability is used to pull expensive units like Thors and Siege Tanks away from the Terran's main army, making them easier targets for the shorter-ranged Zerg army.\n\nAgainst bio play, Vipers are also a good support unit for a Roach-Hydra mid game army. Casting Blinding Clouds on the Terran bio ball will prevent the Marine-Marauder force from firing at the Roach-Hydra force. This forces the Terran to retreat. If the Terran does not micro, the AI will instruct the bio ball to move closer to their target, which makes retreat even harder for a Terran player not paying attention.\n\nNote that Blinding Cloud also affects your own units, and the Terran player can lure the Roach-Hydra force into a trap by feinting a retreat and pulling the Zerg forces into the Blinding Cloud.\n\nAs with Brood Lords, it is important to supplement Vipers with additional anti-air, as they are helpless against Terran's long-range Vikings (their Parasitic Bomb ability, though powerful, is rarely fast enough to save them from a Viking attack).", "question": "What is the primary purpose of using the Viper's Blinding Cloud ability against a Terran Marine-Tank army composition?", "options": ["To prevent the Terran from producing additional units", "To force Siege Tanks to unsiege and remove them from battle", "To increase the movement speed of Zerg units", "To disable the Terran's supply depots"], "answer": "To force Siege Tanks to unsiege and remove them from battle"}

{"document": "# Point Defense Drone (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Point Defense Drone (or PDD for short) was a light-air Terran unit removed in the 4.0.0 patch, it is deployed by a Raven at the cost of 100 energy. The Drone is immobile and cannot attack, but will negate specific enemy projectiles near itself, protecting allied units. The Drone spawns with 200 energy, which allows for up to 20 attacks to be negated. Point Defense Drones can be constructed within 3 range of their host Raven. Once deployed, the Raven can leave the area, and the Drone will remain for its 14-second duration.\n\n- Units with multiple attacks, such as the Phoenix or Thor, require 10 energy per each projectile fired.\n\n- The Point Defense Drone can be destroyed by attacking the drone itself with units which are not countered by its defensive laser, listed below.\n\n- The Point Defense Drone regenerates energy almost twice as fast as other caster units (1.4 energy per second vs 0.7875 energy per second). This allows it to defend against an additional projectile every 7 seconds.\n\n- Although the unit lists Ship Plating as its armor type, the Point Defense Drone's armor is only affected by the Engineering Bay's Building Armor upgrade.\n\n- Is considered a building and mechanical for spell targeting purposes (Immune to the Ghost's Snipe and High Templar's Psionic Storm spells. Also targetable by Corruptor's Caustic Spray spell)\n\n- Can be affected by a Ghost's EMP Round spell, reducing the number of Point Defense Lasers available.\n\n- Can be affected by a High Templar's Feedback spell, destroying it almost every time due to its low HP and high energy.\n\n- As a mechanical unit, the Point Defense Drone can be repaired by friendly SCVs.\n\n- Durable Materials allows the Point Defense Drone to be placed pre-emptively with a lower risk that it will go un-used.\n\n- Will defend against any enemy projectiles that pass through its protective range, even if the attacking and defending units are outside of said range.\n\n- Will consume energy defending attacks from fake units created by Hallucination.\n\n- Point Defense Laser marginally scales as the game progresses, because it negates upgrade damage (In a Marauder vs  Marauder battle, a single PDD would stop 400 damage with no Infantry Weapons upgrades.

{"document": "# Creep\n## Creep Generation\n### Faster Creep Growth\n\nEach Creep Tumor is an independent creep source, so two or more creep tumors in the same area will grow creep much faster. Two adjacent creep tumors will only take about 41 seconds to fill (more than half because each one has a sliver of terrain not covered by the other), and three tumors will take about 26 seconds to fill. However, when creep is spread edge-to-edge, two Creep Tumours should take about 17 s to finish, and three about 11 s. The cooldown on the Spawn Creep Tumor ability is 11 s, so three Creep Tumors approaches the limit of efficiency.\n\nThe other main way to optimize creep growth is spreading along multiple paths. Generally it is beneficial to have creep covering as much of the map as possible, although doing this obviously increases the amount of micro required to maintain the creep spread rate. Also note that since creep will not spread through impassable barriers (walls & cliffs), a Creep Tumor placed against a cliff has less area to fill, and so fills faster. Thus the Zerg can minimize time spent filling tiles not in the desired direction.", "question": "How long does it take for two adjacent Creep Tumors to fill a given area with creep?", "options": ["11 seconds", "17 seconds", "26 seconds", "41 seconds"], "answer": "41 seconds"}

{"document": "# Oracle (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\nOracle play against Terran can be a gamble due to Marines.  Against a greedy or unprepared Terran an Oracle opening will do devastating damage to the economy.  If the Terran player scouts the build or amasses a large number of marines though, the build can be shut down quite quickly. However, surviving oracles are still useful support units, as their fast speed will help deal with small Terran drops in conjunction with photon overcharge. Some players also utilize revelation to great effect in scaring away drops and spotting the late game Terran army to get off critical storms.\n\nIt is important to note that a single Oracle can take up to five Marines without Combat Shield, while two Oracles are only able to eliminate a group of eight or less Marines, these facts are important to remember while going for an Oracle rush or defending one.\n\nWidow Mines are also an effective counter to Oracles as they can one shot them, so watching for them is important when entering a Terran base with Oracles.", "question": "How many Marines can a single Oracle take down without Combat Shield in StarCraft II?", "options": ["3", "5", "7", "10"], "answer": "5"}
{"document": "# Sentry (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nAgainst Zerg, Sentries are considered useful in both the early and midgame. Force Field is vital in helping to block early Zerg rushes, as one Force Field will help block attempts to breach a sim-city at the Protoss natural. An important use of Force Field in the mid-game is to effectively wall off your army from Zerg attackers. Placing Force Fields to reduce the effective surface area of your army makes the Zerg swarm easier to deal with and destroy. Be mindful of Ravagers as Corrosive Bile can destroy Force Fields.\n\nAside from Force Field usage, Guardian Shield is extremely important in mid-game PvZ if a player opts for a style that utilizes Sentries. Guardian Shield greatly decreases the damage that Mutalisks do against Protoss units, and also helps to mitigate the damage that Roaches and Hydralisks do.\n\nSentries are a centerpiece of certain attacks such as the Immortal Sentry all-in that is also usually supported by Adepts with or without Resonating Glaives. These pushes usually involve about 6 or so Sentries and rely on proper Force Field management to be effective.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of using Force Fields against Zerg in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To heal damaged units", "To block off areas and control the flow of battle", "To increase the attack speed of Protoss units", "To summon additional units"], "answer": "To block off areas and control the flow of battle"}

The Cybernetics Core unlocks new units and the Shield Battery building, and enables research of several upgrades. Possessing a Cybernetics Core unlocks the construction of Sentries, Stalkers and Adepts at the Gateway. It also allows the player to research the uniquely Protoss Warp Gate technology. The Cybernetics Core is also the location where upgrades for Air Weapons and Armor are researched.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Cybernetics Core can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. It can only research upgrades while it remains within the Matrix, otherwise it becomes unpowered and cannot function. However, even an unpowered Cybernetics Core still allows the construction of Sentries, Stalkers, Adepts and Shield Batteries.\n\n## Air Weapons Upgrades\n\nThese upgrades affect the following units: Interceptor, Mothership, Phoenix, Tempest, Void Ray.

It is a prerequisite for all non Zealot combat units in the Protoss army, as well as enables the invaluable Warp Gate research. As such it is usually constructed immediately once the first Gateway is finished.\n\nThe only cases when one may not want to construct a Cybernetics Core as soon as possible are when going for (or responding to) an early aggression build with Photon Cannons and/or Zealots, or when opening with an early Nexus.", "question": "Which upgrade, researched at the Cybernetics Core, allows Gateways to be changed into Warp Gates, enhancing the Protoss army's mobility?", "options": ["Air Weapons", "Air Armor", "Warp Gate", "Shield Battery"], "answer": "Warp Gate"}

{"document": "# Blink\n## Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\n- General usage - If the Terran opponent is utilizing highly mobile units such as the Hellion or the Reaper, Blink will allow Stalkers to either catch up to, or retreat from, those forces with greater ease. When Terran players drop units such as the Siege Tank on cliffs (e.g. at the natural expansion on Lost Temple), an Observer can provide vision so that Stalker forces can counter-attack such drops by Blinking up onto the cliff.\n\n- Bypassing Terran 'wall-ins' - It is common for Terran players to wall off their main, and sometimes subsequent expansions by blocking choke-points or ramps with buildings.  This often presents a difficult barrier for Protoss players to overcome, particularly if the Terran is guarding the wall with units such as Siege Tanks.  Using the Blink ability, Stalkers can bypass the Terran wall, possibly allowing additional units of the Protoss army to attack the wall from below.", "question": "How can the Blink ability of Stalkers be effectively used against a Terran player who has walled off their main base with buildings?", "options": ["By attacking the wall directly with Stalkers to break through.", "By using Stalkers to teleport over the wall and attack from the rear.", "By Blinking Stalkers to the top of the wall to siege the Terran base.", "By Blinking Stalkers underground to appear inside the Terran base."], "answer": "By using Stalkers to teleport over the wall and attack from the rear."}

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Terran\n## Overview\n### The Basics\n\nAt the beginning of games, Overlord placement can be tricky, map depending. However, most maps allow players to move their first two Overlords out across the map to helpful positions. In general, you want to send at least one Overlord near the Terran player's natural, to check for expansion timings. For more information, I would suggest watching some player's stream for Overlord placement hints.\n\nAlmost all builds in Zerg versus Terran start off with a 15 Hatchery. To deal with 2 Barracks play, I would heavily suggest scouting at 15 supply with a Drone. Send both the scouting and Hatchery-building Drones from your main mineral line at the same time, one building the Hatchery at your natural and the other moving across the map to scout your opponent. Alternatively, some players opt to go for an earlier scout, sent as early as 12 supply, if they feel insecure holding off 2 Barracks play. Each player should make their own choices on each map, depending on how confident they are on holding off this early cheese.\n\n| The Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 15 - Hatchery; 16 - Spawning Pool; @100% Spawning Pool - Queens x2 |\n|  |\n\n- 15 - Hatchery\n\n- 16 - Spawning Pool\n\n- @100% Spawning Pool - Queens x2", "question": "In Zerg vs. Terran matches, what is the recommended supply count for scouting to deal with 2 Barracks play?", "options": ["12", "14", "16", "18"], "answer": "12"}

{"document": "# 1 Rax FE (vs. Protoss)\n## Adaption\n\nThe build then branches off the build into two slight variations, fast Engineering Bay for Infantry Weapons Level 1 or quick Marauder production. Marauders will give Terran map control until Warpgate finishes, and then Protoss simply has better production mechanics; and Terran needs Medivacs to make up for this.\nTerran also needs a fast Refinery (3) to afford Medivacs and the Add-Ons.\n\nWith fast Engineering Bay, Terran has some timing attacks against fast-Forge and Colossus builds, but has to stop once Extended Thermal Lance is complete and which to Medivac-Harass, instead so Terran can retreat. But, Terran is stuck on mainly Marine production until the economy catches up around the Starport finishing.\n\nAnother possibility is to be extremely greedy and follow the initial Barracks and Bunker with a third Command Center before adding any additional infrastructure. This indicates a preference to play for the long game, and is much more susceptible to a range of Protoss all-ins, including 4-gate, Blink, and Immortal busts. The general follow up to a quick 3CC play is to get the second and third Barracks, double Refinery immediately afterwards, and tech towards Stim and Medivacs as quickly as possible. The traditional midgame timings will be delayed slightly, but the economic boost you get will provide an opportunity to get ahead in upgrades and infrastructure, provided you can stay safe.", "question": "In the context of the 1 Rax FE strategy against Protoss, what is a key reason for Terran to produce Marauders early?", "options": ["To prepare for a late-game siege with Siege Tanks", "To counter the Protoss Warp Prism's mobility", "To gain map control until Protoss completes Warpgate technology", "To immediately attack the Protoss Nexus"], "answer": "To gain map control until Protoss completes Warpgate technology"}

{"document": "# Swarm Host (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nA crucial step in reaching the relatively safe (though the Zerg should have a well-developed ground and air army by this point) Late Game Mothership phase is the use of High Templar in the form of Psionic Storm and Archons. Storm should be researched right away after warping in some Templar to start gathering energy. When a Locust wave approaches, the Protoss will want to pull their Probes away and cast Storm(s) on the Locusts. Some static defenses should be able to clean up the remaining Locusts and will not be damaged from the Storm(s) like any army units would be (Stasis Wards are also considered buildings and will not be affected). With Energy expended, Templar can morph into Archons, which deal massive splash to the often stacked Locusts. Effective Storm/Stasis usage can mitigate much Locust damage on its own, and allows for simple resource spending: Minerals on remaking any lost Nexus/Probes and building up some static while Vespene is dumped into Templar. If the Protoss can effectively stop the bleeding, they will likely let the Swarm Hosts take on a lesser role and focus on getting Chip Damage (small damage over time that adds up) rather than committing to killing bases, while improving their army quality and teching up. A Templar/Archon/Air army should be sufficient to take additional bases and normalize into a typical Late Game with no more need to turtle on a low base count.\n\nMassed Phoenixes can potentially kill locusts before they land if the air travel time is long enough, but their inability to deal with the worms themselves, as well as their weakness against the Swarm Hosts themselves means they should not be used unless the Swarm Hosts are added on after the Protoss has already gone 2 Stargate Phoenix and committed to some already. Once the Swarm Hosts are identified, Oracles should be made. Any Phoenixes made can aide in pushing away Overlords, and a small number may be made for this purpose, but Void Rays will make faster kills, threaten Worms on their own, and be more useful later on against an eventual Corruptor Transition.\n\nThe Protoss' necessary defenses against Swarm Hosts will naturally usher them into a strong, standard Late Game composition, but the Zerg will not be in a great long-term position tech and army-wise (aside from having the Infestation Pit already, in order to go up to Hive. If the Protoss player does not take decisive action, the game can end very or relatively quickly, with no need for the Zerg to tech beyond a Lair. It is typical for the Zerg to stay on Lair tech for a longer time than usual as they build their Swarm Host count and apply heavy pressure using Locust waves combining with Roach/Ravager attacks, either splitting the Protoss' focus in multiple locations or hitting together in order to wipe the field. The Zerg should have dominant map control and be able to take plenty of bases, but because Roach/Ravager/Swarm Host is so costly in terms of supply (but inexpensive in terms of Minerals/Gas, as Roaches are cheap and Locusts are free), it can be difficult to also have a high drone count. An important feature of this playstyle is managing how heavily the Zerg can lean on their opponent; it is crucial to either try to end the game on Lair tech or have a well planned and executed transition once the Locusts stop seeing big returns.", "question": "In the context of defending against Zerg Swarm Hosts, which Protoss unit is most effective for converting High Templar into Archons for dealing massive splash damage to Locusts?", "options": ["Zealot", "Colossus", "High Templar", "Stalker"], "answer": "High Templar"}

SCV micro is a mix of attacking, retreating and holding position to protect your Marines. You will have to use corners as well as your SCVs to make sure they survive until Marines 4 and 5 come, because they will help you kill Drones much faster. If your opponent pulls 10 or more Drones, consider retreating until more SCVs and Marines can join up with your force. When you build the 1st Bunker, you have a few options where to build it.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Protoss\n## Overview\n### The Basics\n#### Scouting\n\nIn general, when scouting, you should remember two timings: 6:30 and ~10:00. At 6:30, the Zerg player needs to scout the Protoss with their 2 Overlords; the first Overlord moving into the main to attempt to see any tech buildings the Protoss player has warped in and the second Overlord moving into the Protoss natural to see how many gasses the Protoss player has taken.\n\n- If the Protoss player has taken only 1 gas at their natural, play like they only have 2 total gases. The Protoss player is likely going for a fast third base or for a Gateway all-in.\n\n- If the Protoss player has taken 2 gases at their natural, play like they have 4 total gases. This could be any range of possibilities: a Sentry-heavy three base (not very common), double Stargates, a Blink all-in, or the ever common Immortal Sentry All-In.\nFor specific strategy on how to defeat the Immortal Sentry All-In, read: Mavvie's guide to defend Immortal Sentry (TL.net)\n\n- For specific strategy on how to defeat the Immortal Sentry All-In, read: Mavvie's guide to defend Immortal Sentry (TL.net)\n\nThe next timing is at ~10:00, which is important to remember. At this timing most 2-base Protoss all-ins will hit. If your opponent is on two bases and you have 60 Drones, you should only be making units (this should be at around the 8:30-9:00 for a professional, however it may be later if your macro is not spot on. That's ok - learn what 60 Drones looks like spread out across 3 bases and learn to estimate while in game). As a general rule, do not stop making units until your opponent takes a third - yes, professionals do sometimes Drone, however as a GENERAL rule continue to produce units.\n\nFinally, always have a Zergling behind your opponent's third base. Get in the habit of doing this; it will let you know if/when your opponent takes a third base, in which case you can stop making units, and proceed into a macro game.", "question": "At which timing should a Zerg player scout the Protoss natural to determine the number of gases taken, indicating potential strategies?", "options": ["3:30", "6:30", "8:30", "10:00"], "answer": "6:30"}

It also hard counters mass Roach and most FE Zerg builds.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 10 - Refinery; 11 - Supply Depot; 11 - Barracks at Choke Point; 11 - Factory at Choke Point; 11 - Orbital Command; 11 - @Factory 100% Starport; 11 - Tech Lab on Barracks (switch with Starport when complete) |\n|  |\n\n- 10 - Refinery\n\n- 11 - Supply Depot\n\n- 11 - Barracks at Choke Point\n\n- 11 - Factory at Choke Point\n\n- 11 - Orbital Command\n\n- 11 - @Factory 100% Starport\n\n- 11 - Tech Lab on Barracks (switch with Starport when complete)\n\nHave 2 or 3 Marines ready by the time your Starport finishes in order to defend against early Zergling/Roach rushes and Overlords. If the Barracks/Factory Wall is not enough to block your choke point completely, (which is absolutely essential), use your Starport to close it up completely. If a small space is left open in your choke point, a Zergling rush could prove devastating. When your Supply Depot finishes, start pumping Banshees and resume SCV production.\n\nYou can build the Tech Lab add-on via the Factory while the Starport is in production.\nIf your are on a large map such as Tal'Darim Altar it is possible to proxy the Starport. Doing this will mean slower production for the first Banshee (as you have to build the Tech Lab)however this will be countered by the closer flight path as well as reduced times on all subsequent Banshees.\n\n## The Attack\n\nStart the harass as soon as possible. Banshee wins 1v1 with a Queen. Banshees win 2v1 with a Spore Crawler. The point of this build is to damage the Zerg to the point of losing, or severely enough that you can expand and transition. If you scout 1 base Lair, stop producing Banshees and begin the transition into another build (see below).\n\n## Transitioning\n\nIf you do not win outright with this build, you have a few options:\n\n- vs 1 base Lair, you can toss down 2 more Barracks and switch to a standard 3 Barracks build.\n\n- vs fast expand into fast Lair, throw down more Refineries and another Factory with Tech Lab and begin Thor+Hellion production.\n\n- vs fast expand with a second Queen or army production, (coming soon)\n\n- If you see early gas with a Baneling Nest, throw up a Bunker by the weakest part of your wall and begin producing Marines,as a Baneling bust is coming.\n\n## Countering\n\n- 2-3 Spore Crawlers with good positioning can hold off Banshees (or kill them outright) and still allows fast Baneling bust if the Terran wall uses Supply Depots or the Tech Lab\n\n## Map Specific Notes\n\n- This build is extremely weak on Scrap Station due to the very short aerial path Overlords can take to scout it.  In addition to the large ramp, a Zergling or Speedling run-by will easily shred this build.\n\n- On Blistering Sands, this build can be tricky.  You must sacrifice some econ until you plant the Supply Depot in order to keep an eye on the rocks, which can throw off the timing of the build.\n\n- On Metalopolis, if the Zerg does not take his natural, Banshees will have easy access to the mineral line.\n\n- This works well in 2v2 matches well enough as long as you're not playing on Twilight Fortress, which has a huge ramp and is commonly plagued by double-rush strategies.\n\n- Despite the short Overlord scout path, Desert Oasis is a strong map for this build due to the huge ground path and small chokes.\n\n## Videos\n\n- KOTBH MLG Showmatch IdrA vs CauthonLuck 3 of 5\n\n## Notes\n\nAs of patch 1.1.2 this build is no longer as effective, although it still works, as a Supply Depot is required to be built before a Barracks can begin construction.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of the 111 Tech Banshee rush in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To create a large army of Marines", "To catch the Zerg off-guard with early Banshees", "To build a strong economy before attacking", "To scout the enemy base with Overlords"], "answer": "To catch the Zerg off-guard with early Banshees"}

This is effective as three shots are required to kill SCVs and Marines.

{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Execution\n\nLike the 1rax FE from BW, this is not a timing push build. It is an adaptive opener with heavy emphasis on strong mechanics. It will take ample practice to become comfortable with it. Your goal between 7–10 minutes is to simply \"stay-alive\", while past that point, you can choose to transition into macro-fest or an aggressive playstyle.\n\nThere are four points to keep in mind:\n\n- Strong simcity is absolutely crucial and plays a significant role against 2 hatch eco Baneling bust. Bunkers can and should be built when you take you natural, as they can refunded at any time. Furthermore, place your OCs as far away from cliffs as possible. You want to deny Overlord scouting of the 4OCs between 6:00-8:30 with a group of 3-4 Marines patrolling the cliffs (you can use shift-P to queue patrols).\n\n- Perfect your macro ability. Keep your money low without excessive queuing and make enough production structures. You can easily support 8 Raxes (4 reactored + 4 Tech Labs) and 2 Facts (pumping out tanks/Thors). When entering mid-late game, always have 2 Starports (1 Tech Lab, 1 reactor) to prepare for the Brood Lord transition. Upgrades can be had very early with this build. You should always double eBay and in some instances, double Armory. As a general timing guide, you should be able to finish 2/2 infantry upgrades by around 16 minutes. The +2 Building Armor upgrade should always be taken as it will help you secure additional expansions and deal with Mutalisk harass.\n\n- Proper scouting techniques will save you time and money. Learn to conserve scans and instead use the energy into MULEs. In mid-game, once your natural has been safely secured, Terran players with good micro should avoid using scans to determine the Zerg's tech path. Instead, they should use a floating Barracks to scout. Ideal timing for your scouting rax should be around 8 minutes. A scan will effectively cost you about 270  Minerals:, where as a Barracks would cost only 150  Minerals: and can be re-used up to 3-4 times as well as delay Mutalisk harass. Scans should be saved for aggressively removing Creep Tumors (before you have Ravens) and as a spotter for tanks in a pinch (though again, this can be done by simply floating raxes). You should always have a Marine or an SCV at Zerg's 3rd and 4th expos, this is arguably the most cost-saving measure you can do.\n\n- Your 3rd and 4th expansions should be taken consistently throughout the game. You should always secure your 3rd and 4th by means of a Planetary Fortress despite its cost (550/150). By around 12 minutes, it only takes you less than 18 seconds to gather the need resources for a PF expansion. Your target expansion site should always have one turrets set up before you land your CC (in case of burrowed Banelings), with additional turrets added as you maynard (transfer) SCVs.

{"document": "# Damage per second\n## Explanation of DPS\n### Shortcomings\n\nRelying on DPS to ascertain a unit's worth is inadvisable due to several key shortcomings.\n\nFirst, DPS does not account for Splash damage.  For example, the Archon's DPS is technically 19.95(+2.39), and this would be the case if the Archon were fighting a solitary opponent.  However, when an Archon attacks an opponent closely surrounded by several opponent units, the Archon does damage to all of the opponent units.  Depending on the number and spacing of the opponent units, the actual damage dealt may be many times what the DPS value of the Archon predicts.\n\nSecond, base DPS does not take into account the object being attacked. It is only a measure of the damage output of the unit doing the damage. DPS can be reduced by the opposing unit's Armor Value, which decreases the Attack Value of the attacking unit by the Armor Value of the unit being attacked. Furthermore, some weapons have bonus damage against certain Attributes, the tags that belong to each unit; if a unit has a bonus against Armoured and the defender is not armoured then the damage dealt by that unit will be lower than the highest it could be.\n\nThirdly, because DPS is an average, it suffers from several key problems, [1] which can lead to some problems when the attack value or cooldown of a unit is relatively high and the time frame being considered is relatively small.\nFor example, a Siege Tank in Siege Mode does a base damage of 40 versus non-armored units and has a cooldown of 2.14 seconds, and therefore has a DPS value of 18.67 damage.  Assuming an attack against a single non-armored opponent unit, the DPS value would suggest that 1 second after the tank began to attack it would have dealt 8.72 damage.  However 1 second after it began, the tank would actually have dealt 40 damage, because the Siege Tank's attack occurred at 0 s, and all damage was done at that moment. Similar discrepancies will occur when using DPS to predict damage output at any interval between its attacks, although as the number of times the attack has occured increases, the discrepancy between actual damage output and predicted damage output decreases.\n\nDPS can also be deceptive about how much damage enemy units will take. For example, the Thor's ground weapon DPS is the highest in the game, 65.63, but because it is dealt in 60 damage volleys, much of the damage will be wasted in overkill against low-health opponents.\n\nFinally, as some units and abilities deal one-time damage only, Damage per second cannot be calculated.  These include the Baneling, and Tactical Nuke.", "question": "Which of the following is a reason why relying solely on Damage Per Second (DPS) can be misleading when assessing a unit's effectiveness in StarCraft II?", "options": ["DPS accounts for splash damage, making it an accurate measure of a unit's effectiveness.", "DPS considers the armor value of the unit being attacked, ensuring precise damage calculations.", "DPS does not take into account the object being attacked, as it only measures the damage output of the attacking unit.", "DPS is always accurate regardless of the attack value or cooldown of the unit."], "answer": "DPS does not take into account the object being attacked, as it only measures the damage output of the attacking unit."}

Seeing that TRUE was indeed mining gas and had not just gone for fast speed, he started a Tech Lab instead of a Reactor to add a Siege Tank before going back into Reactor Hellions. This proves to be crucial in holding the two base speed Zergling plus Baneling attack that TRUE does shortly afterward. While the Siege Tank makes on the Tech Lab that the Barracks donated, the Barracks produces the Reactor. It makes for a very seamless transition right back into the Hellion into 4M play that FanTaSy wanted to do from the start of the game.\n\nFanTaSy pulls his Reapers back then until around seven minutes and then he suicides them to scout the tech choice of TRUE. From there, he follows a very standard mid-game build, getting a very fast third Command Center and fast two Engineering Bays. He positions his units to deal with the attack before it arrives. He uses the four Hellions that he has - numbers five and six still in production - to scout out the area outside his natural looking for Zerglings and Banelings (he sadly loses them to a surround but that should not have happened). Important to note, he has his Siege Tank on the high ground and every Marine in his main behind raised Supply Depots (he does leave four marines in the bunker at his natural). After crushing the attack, he executes a double pronged attack with eight Marines in a Medivac and six Hellions. He takes his third behind this and plays out much like any other 4M game.\n\nTaeJa goes for a similar concept against KangHo. He does not get a scout off on the Zerg's gas, but I believe he was metagaming KangHo's style and planned to make the Tank regardless. He actually just makes a Reactor on the Barracks and builds Marines out of it and the Factory makes its own Tech Lab. He switches them after having a Tank finish.", "question": "What unit does FanTaSy add to his build to hold off the Zergling plus Baneling attack after scouting the Zerg's gas usage?", "options": ["Reaper", "Hellion", "Siege Tank", "Marine"], "answer": "Siege Tank"}
{"document": "# 4\n## Openings\n### Reaper Fast Expand\n\nAt least 10-20 seconds before Zergling speed can possibly be done, your Reapers must vacate the enemy base. If all went well, you forced out an early Extractor, several Zerglings, and maybe even netted a few Drone or Zergling kills. Maybe he even wasted money on an early Spine Crawler. Things can only go horribly wrong if you lose one or even both of the Reapers. The retreated Reapers can safely clear out watch towers and check for isolated units around the map if you desire. Their current goal is to join up with the Hellions that are going to be coming out of your factory. It is very advisable to join the Reapers up with your first Hellions in a defensive formation at your ramp to defend possible Speedling aggression (in the form of 15+ Speedlings). This is necessary as you presumably will not have a wall at this point.\n\nThe placement of your first Bunker should be a map-dependent choice. Maps that have a larger opening (11 squares wide) to the natural expansion favor a bunker that is placed near or adjacent to the ramp leading from your natural to your main. Depending on the map layout, you will be very uncomfortable if the Zerg decides to hide a pack of Speedlings on the map and uses them to back stab you as you move out with Reaper/Hellion. On maps with a smaller opening to the natural (9 squares), you can wall off in time (reactively if needed even) without too much worries.\n\nWhen the first four Hellions come out of the Factory, join them up with the two Reapers to check around the map for a third Zerg base. If you find a third base, you do not need to prepare for a two base tech play and can exercise map control. Kill anything at the watchtowers and stop any tumors on the edge of creep while you wait for your fifth and sixth Hellion to join up with the other Hellions and two Reapers. Once you have all six Hellions and the two Reapers, you can hit a timing where you can be more aggressive onto Creep than would normally feel safe (this timing ends once the Zerg has some kind of tech besides Zergling speed, usually Banelings, Mutas, or Roaches). This aggression must be done cautiously as Speedlings can surround your force very quickly when you are on Creep. If you feel like taking a risk, you can poke onto Creep to attack Queens or kill Drones if he has any at his third base. Focus on not allowing a Zergling surround to occur and do not try to trade units at this time. Realize that you should be aggressive and that if he does not have a scary amount of lings, you will need to punish his greed in order to not fall behind. A great way to judge how aggressive to be is to check the Drone count at his third base. If he seems to have too many Drones, you can count on him being low on Zerglings; this is an opening to punish his greed. As his tech comes into effect, pull the units back to help defend your third. This is the final and most important purpose of the six Hellions. These hellions are the only thing you have to stand on when trying to secure your third base. If you lose the hellions before this time, you will run into a lot of trouble (and probably lose the game) trying to establish your third vs Speedling or Baneling play by the Zerg. Ideally, this force of six Hellions (and the two Reapers, though they are not as important after this timing) can join up with your Marines and Medivacs as +1/+1 and Stim come into play to execute a 11:30 Creep clearing poke as you transition into the mid game.", "question": "When should you be more aggressive in attacking Zerg structures or units on Creep during a Reaper Fast Expand strategy?", "options": ["Once the Zerg has Roaches or Mutas", "Before the Zerg has any tech besides Zergling speed", "After the Zerg has completed its third base", "When you have fewer than six Hellions"], "answer": "Before the Zerg has any tech besides Zergling speed"}

{"document": "# Stalker (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nStalkers are useful for preventing any early Reaper or Hellion harassment. However before getting Blink towards the midgame, Stalkers can be difficult to use in the because of the Marauder's Concussive Shells ability, which slows Stalkers to a crawl and makes them easy prey. Stalkers with Blink can be used to harass an enemy Terran if taken early such as bypassing a Bunker-heavy fast expansion, or alternatively access the main base high ground on some maps (an Observer or Sentry Hallucination will be required to gain vision, depending on intended followup to the timing attack).\n\nHowever in Legacy of the Void in particular, Stalkers tend to fall off past the Blink timing, where late in the matchup their Armored tag becomes a hinderance rather than an advantage. Blink can help Stalkers blink in to remove a few early Tanks, but multiple Tanks are very strong against Stalkers – which with the type bonus, take a total of 70 damage per siege shot fired. Secondly, the need for Protoss Ground to Air is currently somewhat reduced as Terrans rarely need to use Vikings.[1] Although on the other hand, Stalkers still make excellent units for defending against Terran air harassment units such as Medivac drops, and Liberators, particularly with their ability to Blink past the Defender Mode attack zones, or to negate the Terran's use of cliffs.\n\nIt should be noted that when playing a Blink Stalker Disruptor style the goal for the Protoss player is to maintain as much distance as possible and use long range aoe splash to deter the Terran bio ball.\n\nFinally, as with other matchups, Blink can be used to feint and bait the opponent into overresponding.

{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Execution\n### Late-Game Play-style\n\nEntering late-game via 4OC as Terran is usually favorable as you have an OC backed economy (translating to 500-600 more mineral income on average than other builds). However, 4OC can lead into a late-game stalemate where both you and your opponent are on 4+ more bases. By this stage, most Zergs will opt for a Brood Lord/Corruptor/Infestor combination whereby he forces you to mass Vikings/Thor followed by a quick tech switch to Ultralisk/crackling/Infestor, leaving you with a group of relatively useless Vikings taking up supply. However, there is a strategy utilizing Terran's Planetary Fortress to swing late-game into your favor.\n\nIt is critical to observe the following when dealing with the late-game TvZ:\n\n- Be sure to actively deny creep, you must be able to make room for the PFs. Invest in several Planetary Fortresses and place them in key choke-points, preferably near the middle of the map. Think of Planetary fortresses as a static, no-supply tank that costs only 550/150. Furthermore, PFs do their max damage of 40 against all unit types with the same splash radius as the Siege Tank. You can elect to support PFs with Turrets/Supply depots as needed. PFs also have the added benefit of screwing up Ultralisk AI and serving as the primary target in an engagement for any unit that Zerg a-moves against.\n\n- Make sure you have the +2 Building Armor upgrade. Your PF will then have 5 armor, meaning Broodlings will do significantly less damage. It will buy you extra time when Brood Lords come out.\n\n- Make sure you have at least 2 Starports (1 reactor, 1 Tech Lab) so you can to quickly mass Vikings if he double tech-switch back to Brood Lords. 3 Starports would be preferred in very late-game.\n\n- Keep as many tanks alive as possible at all times. Remember to have ~10 SCVs nearby to mass repair.\n\n- Blue flame Hellions can 2-shot an entire Hatchery's Larvae supply. Unlike drones and other units, Larvae cannot escape - making them extremely good targets for Hellions. It is important to approach hatcheries from the side to line-up the flame angle. Late game Zerg tend to stockpile up to 24 Larvae per Hatchery. Thus, it is of absolute importance to consistently deny Larvae before engaging in army trades. Every Larvae killed delays unit production by 10–15 seconds.\n\n- The key to dealing with mass Corruptor to counter your Vikings is thepoint defense drone, Corruptors attack very slowly and hit very hard. A single PDD can nullify up to 280 damage and more.\n\n- You can take advantage of the slow mobility of ultras/blords by consistently multi-dropping, target gas geysers, Infestation Pits, Ultralisk Caverns, and Greater Spires above everything else.\n\nProceed with your slow-push, constantly reinforcing with Planetary Fortress, Missile Turrets, tanks, and some Thors (in case of mutas). In fact, it is preferable to use buildings (Bunkers, turrets, PFs) as a mineral sink in late-game, as opposed to spamming Marines primarily because buildings require no supply and can soak up significantly more damage.", "question": "What upgrade is critical to have for Planetary Fortresses to increase their durability against Brood Lord attacks in late-game Terran vs Zerg?", "options": ["+2 Building Armor", "+1 Ground Weapons", "+2 Ground Weapons", "+1 Building Armor"], "answer": "+2 Building Armor"}

{"document": "# Scouting\n## Mid/Late Game Scouting\n### Terran\n\n- After creating a Barracks, Terran can upgrade their Command Center into an Orbital Command which can cast Scanner Sweep on a portion of the map, revealing any enemy units and buildings. That, however, is often not the best choice because Orbital Command energy can be used for MULEs instead.\n\n- Terran players can also float their buildings for scouting. Their low speed is compensated by a large amount of hitpoints for relatively low cost.  A well-executed example of this tactic is employed by TLO in TLO vs Nony on Lost Temple.  The Barracks is comparable to the cost of a Scanner Sweep ( Minerals: 150 + SCV time off the mineral line, vs.  Minerals: 270 from a MULE over the next 90 seconds), but has the advantage of being able to linger over the base by moving to the fringes of the map and brought back again for a peek when ranged defenders are away.

As this structure is late in the tech tree, this will depend on the construction timings of all of the Gateway, Cybernetics Core, and Twilight Council before it.

Zerg may also amass Speedlings to counter Thor and Hellion.\n\n- Terran is going Air: against air-heavy Terran, it is logical for Zerg to get Hydralisks and Spore Crawlers.\n\nAs long as Ghost Academy and a Ghost is hidden from Zerg's point of view, Overseer is usually delayed until they see Ghost or Banshee, which leaves an opening for a cloaked Ghost to nuke the base freely. Use Hellions to distract and eat away any fleeing drones while nuking the base. Continue producing Nukes afterward and nuke Zerg's 3rd expansion or other exploitable areas.\n\nOnce you have a sizable army consisting of a Ghost, push to the Zerg's base. Use a nuke to destroy the static defenses at the front. Most of time with 1 Medivac healing Ghosts and other armies protecting it, it is extremely difficult to take down a cloaked Ghost nuking down Zerg's front base. Even if your rush has failed, you can still pump Ghosts until Zerg gets Tier 3 units and deal with most of Zerg units while you yourself either go expand or complete your MMM balls.\n\nUse of Snipe\n\nNOTE: As of patch 1.4.3, the damage of Snipe is reduced to 25 (+25 vs Psionic), severely decreasing its usefulness overall (especially against Zerg) and making the below section outdated and, for all-intents and purposes, null and void.\n\nSnipe can deal 45 direct damage to any Zerg units at a range of 10. Snipe can;\n\n- 1-shot Drone, Zergling, and Baneling\n\n- 2-shot Hydralisk and Infestor\n\n- 3-shot Mutalisk and Roach\n\nBaneling, Mutalisk, and Hydralisk are prioritized for sniping as they have higher DPS than others.\n\nSimply select all your Ghosts and press \"R\" and left click Zerg units repeatedly to execute Snipe. You can shift-click Snipe ability to instantly take out all of Zerg's units as well. Whenever you see Infestors, just cloak your Ghosts and either Snipe or EMP them.

{"document": "# Carrier (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nVikings, while killed in 2 volleys by Carriers, are less than a third of the cost, and while one Carrier will defeat 3 Vikings, this is the only match-up where the Carrier wins cost-for-cost: 4 Vikings will defeat one Carrier, and 6 Vikings will defeat 2 Carriers if they focus their fire. Vikings are a very soft counter, though and can't kite Carriers after Interceptors grab a target, so with appropriate micro, Carriers can stay competitive. Marines can't out range a well placed Carrier (besides getting shredded by the Carrier's improved targeting AI), though if they can get within range, cost-for-cost, Marines are also a good defense. Terrans have the best options for killing Interceptors, so careful management of your squadrons is key.\n\nBeware of heavy AA emplacements. A location fortified with Marines and Missile Turrets can quickly turn Interceptor squadrons into dust. Interceptors no longer recover max health between sorties as they did in Brood War, and while large numbers can withstand a serious beating overall, they will not last long enough to break a sustained anti air defense.\n\nBe cautious of flying structures. Carriers will automatically launch Interceptor squadrons at targets in range, and clever Terrans may use this to tease your Interceptors into a hail of gunfire at minimal risk.\n\nBattlecruisers are extremely dangerous to contend with. With 3 base armor, a Battlecruiser with equal upgrades takes 40% damage from Interceptors, and will wipe out a full squadron in half the time you need to take one down. Attempting to kill Battlecruisers with Interceptors can turn into a huge mineral drain that leaves your Carriers vulnerable. To top it off, a well placed Yamato Cannon can severely damage or kill your Carriers outright, making it a bad idea to go toe to toe against a Terran victory fleet.\n\nCarriers are very powerful against a Terran that is going for a mechanical composition (which includes primarily Hellions, Siege Tanks, Thors, and Banshees). Carriers, if unscouted, supplement a typical Protoss composition very well because of the lack of anti-air in the Terran's army. However, it scouted, Vikings will almost definitely be made as a direct counter, so it is important to not over-commit to Carriers in this type of situation, and use them to either destroy the Terran army and/or to force an overproduction of Vikings.", "question": "In StarCraft II, how many Vikings are needed to defeat one Carrier cost-for-cost?", "options": ["2 Vikings", "3 Vikings", "4 Vikings", "5 Vikings"], "answer": "4 Vikings"}

Note that this only takes 17 seconds and costs very little resources.

{"document": "# Game Speed\n\nGame Speed is the speed at which your game runs. There are five speed settings to choose from: Slower, Slow, Normal, Fast and Faster. Faster is the default speed for custom and ladder matches. In the campaign, co-op and versus AI modes, the game speed is set based on the selected difficulty (e.g., Normal difficulty runs at Normal speed, Brutal difficulty at Faster).\n\nIn custom games the game speed can be set in the lobby by the host. In games with only one human player it can be altered during play in the Gameplay options. An exception to this is the campaign on Brutal difficulty, which locks the game speed at Faster.\n\nInternally, as well as in the editor, all time-related values are based on Normal speed. Depending on the game speed setting, the game simulation is simply run at different speeds. The table below shows the simulation speed factors of the five game speed settings.\n\n| Game Speed | Speed Factor | Real-Time Seconds in 1 Minute Normal Time |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Slower | 0.6 | 100 |\n| Slow | 0.8 | 75 |\n| Normal | 1.0 | 60 |\n| Fast | 1.2 | 50 |\n| Faster | 1.4 | 42.86 |\n\nOn Liquipedia, all Legacy of the Void pages use real-time time and speed values corresponding to Faster game speed. All Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm pages assume Normal game speed.\nThis matches the values that one would see in a standard ladder match (Faster game speed) in the respective game versions.\n\n## Legacy of the Void\n\nStarting with Legacy of the Void, all time-related values shown in game will now display real-time seconds. That includes tooltips (including build time and attack cooldown details), progress bars on active buildings or morphed units, and the match clock which is shown above the minimap. As an example, depending on the game speed a Marine may take between 18, 25 or 42 seconds to train (at faster, normal, or slower game speed respectively), and this will be reflected in both the tooltips for training units in the Barracks's building command card, and the tooltip for units already in the training queue for the Barracks.\n\nIn the observer, replay, and post-game statistical interfaces, APM values displayed are now always based on real-time (or, for replays, what was real-time when the game was played). Replays store the speed at which they were recorded such that playing a replay back at a different speed will make the in-game clock not show real-time.\n\nOn Liquipedia, unit statistics provided in infoboxes are at faster speed. In addition to the stats shown in game, the infoboxes also provide additional info in the form of rates of damage per second and the move speed. These are are also adjusted for the game clock, compared to same rates provided on pages for previous expansions.\n\n## Before Legacy of the Void\n\nBefore Legacy of the Void, all time-related values shown in game were assuming Normal speed, so when playing on Faster, they were incorrect in terms of real-time seconds. For example, the MULE tooltip said that a MULE would last for 90 seconds, but in a standard game on Faster, it would actually only last 65 seconds real-time.\n\nAPM was calculated based on Normal time passed. This meant that if you were playing on Faster, it would be calculating your actions per ~43 seconds real-time.\nReplays would also not store the game speed the game was recorded at.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- When the game timer reaches 215 game seconds (6 hours, 30 minutes, 6 seconds of real time on Faster) the game will automatically end as a loss for all players. It is speculated this is due to an overflow error on a signed 16-bit integer variable (which cannot express values larger than 215).\n\n- The game clock will add an hours space on screen when 1 hour of Normal time has elapsed, regardless of whether or not 1 hour of real time has passed.", "question": "At which game speed setting does a unit that takes 42 seconds to train at Slower speed complete its training in 18 seconds?", "options": ["Slower", "Slow", "Normal", "Faster"], "answer": "Faster"}
{"document": "# Artosis Pylon\n\nAn Artosis Pylon is a single Pylon responsible for powering multiple structures in a Protoss base. It is a vulnerability because an opponent could significantly disrupt the Protoss player's production, tech advancement, and/or base defenses by destroying that one Pylon.\n\n## Origin\n\nIn an NASL cast, IdrA labeled one of CrunCher's's Pylons (which was alone powering several important buildings) as being an 'Artosis Pylon'. The reference was to the NASL Season 1 Week 4 game (Artosis vs Fenix), where Artosis lost power to several important tech and production buildings when Fenix took out a single Pylon.\n\nWhile Artosis is not the first or last player to make this mistake, IdrA was the first to name the error on such a popular broadcast. While it began as a friendly joke, it quickly became this standard term.\n\n## Tasteless Pylon\n\nDuring a 2013 DreamHack Open Stockholm semifinal between HerO and Leenock, the defensive line of HerO was breached by the Zergling rush of Leenock. The entirety of HerO's defense was powered by a single Pylon which was quickly targeted down and destroyed by attacking Zerglings.

{"document": "# Sentry (Legacy of the Void)\n## Spells\n\nForce Field\nCaster: Sentry 50\nRange: 9\nDuration: 11\nRadius: 1.7\nBarrier that lasts 11 seconds and impedes movement of ground units. Massive units will shatter Force Fields on contact. Hallucinated Massive units cannot shatter Force Fields.\n\nThe Force Field spell instantly blocks an area on the ground, preventing movement for all non-massive ground units for 11 seconds. This ability can be used for tactical maneuvers such as blocking ramps, trapping enemy units, narrowing chokes or separating armies into multiple parts. Force fields can be destroyed by walking over them with a massive unit. Sentries spawn with the exact amount of energy necessary for this spell (50 energy), so it may be cast immediately upon warp in. This feature is invaluable when used in conjunction with Warp Gates, as any ramp on the map near a Pylon may be blocked off within seconds. For example, a critical mass of six sentries regenerate energy quickly enough to keep a sufficiently small ramp or choke continually blocked with Force Fields.\n\nGuardian Shield\nCaster: Sentry 75\nDuration: 12.86\nRadius: 4.5\nCreates a range 4.5 aura that reduces incoming ranged damage to friendly units by 2. Lasts 12.86 seconds.\n\nThe Guardian Shield reduces incoming ranged attack damage by 2 per hit for all friendly units inside a large radius (4.5) around the Sentry for 11 seconds. The shield appears as a large spherical barrier around the Protoss army, capable of protecting both ground and air units. This means a single sentry is capable of massively decreasing an opponent's DPS in large battles, making it a high priority target for opposing armies. The Guardian Shield spell increases the effectiveness of Protoss units against Mutalisks. This is because each bounce of the Mutalisk's attack has its damage reduced by 2, i.e. so with Guardian shield the first hit does 7 damage, the second hit does 1 damage and the third hit also does 1 damage instead of the 9-3-1 pattern you would usually see. By the same principle, they are effective against any low damage, high rate of attack type units (such as Marines). Overlapping Guardian Shields do not stack in effect.[1] This spell costs 75 energy to cast, meaning that energy must be saved after the Sentry first warps in. Also, Guardian Shield does not reduce damage from the Oracle's Pulsar Beam.\n\nHallucination\nCaster: Sentry 75\nRange: 0\nCreates hallucinations of Protoss units at the caster's location, that cannot use active abilities, cannot deal damage, and die more easily. Enemy detectors can reveal hallucinations.\n\nThe Hallucination spell creates a fake replica of a Protoss unit that appears like a real unit to opponents lacking a detector. The hallucinated unit takes twice as much damage as a real unit and is incapable of dealing damage, but hallucinations prove useful in several ways. First, hallucinations are often used for scouting the opponent without risking the loss of any units.  During battles, hallucinations can distract and absorb enemy fire.  They can also be used early in the game (before detectors) to trick players into misinterpreting your strategy, or even leaving the game early if they feel terribly outmatched by the sheer number of (fake) units they see facing them.[2] This ability previously required research at the Cybernetics Core. However, this requirement was removed with Heart of the Swarm.

{"document": "# 2 Base Templar (vs. Terran)\n## Variations\n### Dark Templar Drop\n\nA popular option is to go for a Dark Templar drop off 2 bases: delaying Storm and Charge in exchange for much more powerful harassment. While this variation can be done against any build, it can be somewhat tricky to hold off a Medivac timing. Depending on how well the Terran defends the DT's you can be severely behind. It is, however, a great choice against harassment builds, and was extremely popular before the Hellbat nerf when Terrans were rushing for a Starport and Armory rather than going for Medivac pushes.\n\n| DT Drops |\n| --- |\n| 1 Gate expand, make one extra Sentry for a total of 3.; 6:30 Natural gasses.; Units off the Robo: 2x Obs, Warp Prism, 1x Obs, Immortal 3x.; 7:00 Twilight Council.; As soon as the Council completes: Charge, +1 attack and Dark Shrine as gas allows, in this order.; 8:40 Gates 4 and 5.; 9:05 Gates 6 and 7.; Templar Archives after defending the Medivac timing, at about 11:30.; Take a third behind the harassment once the Terran stops being aggressive, this should be between the 11 and 13 minute mark. |\n|  |\n\n- 1 Gate expand, make one extra Sentry for a total of 3.\n\n- 6:30 Natural gasses.\n\n- Units off the Robo: 2x Obs, Warp Prism, 1x Obs, Immortal 3x.\n\n- 7:00 Twilight Council.\n\n- As soon as the Council completes: Charge, +1 attack and Dark Shrine as gas allows, in this order.\n\n- 8:40 Gates 4 and 5.\n\n- 9:05 Gates 6 and 7.\n\n- Templar Archives after defending the Medivac timing, at about 11:30.\n\n- Take a third behind the harassment once the Terran stops being aggressive, this should be between the 11 and 13 minute mark.\n\nThe goal of the DTs is to delay him and punish him for getting caught out of position or for messing up earlier in the game. Going for DTs can allow you to take a normally timed third with a relatively small army. Since DTs are such a big investment, you have to be extremely careful with them. Keep them split up so each DT takes one scan to kill, and be very careful with how many you make. After your first drop of two or so, he will likely save scans and have turrets in position, so only make DTs if you know he is out of position.\n\nAs usual, the general rule is to go up to six or seven Gates before taking a third against bio timings. Against 3CC or mech, take your third earlier.

{"document": "# 1 Rax Marauder (vs. Protoss)\n## Execution\n### Adaptation\n\nWhen the Protoss becomes aware of the Marauder opening, your opponent will abandon any economy-centered opening strategy and be forced to invest in Stalkers. your opponent will either try to play aggressive in order to prevent containment before the Concussive Shells have finished, or turtle on your opponent's ramp and eventually tech to either High Templar, which your opponent will use to chase you away with Psi Storms, or Void Rays, which your opponent will most likely use to harass your mineral line. In order to know what your opponent is going after your containment has been set up, use the Orbital Command's Scanner Sweep ability on the Protoss base once the initial fighting begins to die down.\n\nAs in Brood War, the most natural choice after completing the initial containment is to expand, in which case this build will turn into 1 Rax FE. However, the Siege push is advisable if an early win is desired and the Protoss is far behind going into the mid game. The Marauders can either maintain the containment or provide a human shield for the Siege Tanks.\n\nIf this build has ended up putting you behind (probably because the Protoss cheesed or because you were too aggressive with your Marauders against his fast Stalkers), the most advisable course of action is to switch back to Marines and try to produce a Reaper or two with which to pressure or harass the Protoss while you try to setup a transition into the mid game and rebuild your forces.\n\nIt will be unlikely that an expansion can be made for some time if the Protoss has broken your containment. Therefore a transition to the Siege Expand build, which is frequently used by Tarson when playing against an unknown Protoss build, with roughly 5 Marines and 1 Marauder for every Siege Tank allows an attempt to expand as soon as possible. This offsets economic losses due to the lost Marauders in the opening.\n\n... and of course there is always the follow-through mid game strategy of going for a Barracks-heavy build where you simply try to overwhelm the Protoss. After all, there will already be at most 2 Barracks available by the time for the mid game transition.", "question": "What is the recommended course of action if the 1 Rax Marauder build has put you behind against a Protoss player?", "options": ["Expand immediately and build more Marauders", "Switch back to Marines and produce a Reaper or two", "Focus on building more Siege Tanks for a Siege push", "Build a large number of Bunkers to defend"], "answer": "Switch back to Marines and produce a Reaper or two"}

At the security camera before the cargo bay, the player can equip a warbot with one of three weapon options: Anti-Armor Missiles, Anti-Personnel Napalm, or All-Purpose Cannons. The warbot will remain until its health is used up or its duration (75 seconds) expires. Regardless of the weapon upgrade chosen, the high hit points of the ARES make it useful for taking damage from enemy units.\n\n## Anti-Armor Missiles\n\nThis is the best option to choose since it can quickly deal damage to the most dangerous units in the rooms ahead. If you are saving the ARES to fight the Brutalisk, this is the best choice.\n\n## Anti-Personnel Napalm\n\nThis weapon fires two lines of flame, similar to a Hellion's attack, and deals bonus damage against Biological units. It deals damage to all units within the flame area. If using this upgrade, try to line up the attack so that the flame hits multiple marines in the flame area. Despite its bonus against Biological units, this weapon upgrade deals damage to the Brutalisk the slowest.\n\n## All-Purpose Cannons\n\nThese weapons deal the highest DPS of the three weapon choices if no bonuses are included.

While it's the aesthetics that draw you in, it's the Main-Nat-Third area that keeps you hooked. Dash and Terminal has one of the most dangerous naturals that has been seen in TLMC. The natural has two smaller than average chokes on opposite sides to defend, that can make expanding somewhat tricky and players will need to carefully plan their sim cities as a result. Additionally there are rocks which can be destroyed opening up a third route into the natural. To compensate for the difficult natural, the third base is extremely close and easy to hold. The rest of the map provides an interesting battleground and offers players a difficult to defend gold base, if they are willing to take the risk.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nTeamLiquid map contest finalist.\n\nCreated by SeinGalton.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n## Strategies\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Dash and Terminal433116575949.1%110634757.3%74393552.7%342871\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Dash and Terminal | 433 | 116 | 57 | 59 | 49.1% | 110 | 63 | 47 | 57.3% | 74 | 39 | 35 | 52.7% | 34 | 28 | 71 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2015-11-012015-11-072015 WCS Global Finals2015-09-242015-09-252015 Dream\nHack Open: Stockholm2015-08-132015-09-132015 WCS Season 3 Premier League2015-08-302015-08-31\nMSI Masters Gaming Arena 20152015-08-052015-08-09\nIEM Season X - gamescom2015-07-162015-07-19\nIEM Season X - Shenzhen2015-07-162015-07-172015 Dream\nHack Open: Valencia2015-07-062015-07-12\nLOTTE Homeshopping 2015 Ke\nSPA Cup Season 22015-07-022015-07-05\nHome\nStory Cup XI\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015-11-01 | 2015-11-07 |  | 2015 WCS Global Finals |\n| 2015-09-24 | 2015-09-25 |  | 2015 DreamHack Open: Stockholm |\n| 2015-08-13 | 2015-09-13 |  | 2015 WCS Season 3 Premier League |\n| 2015-08-30 | 2015-08-31 |  | MSI Masters Gaming Arena 2015 |\n| 2015-08-05 | 2015-08-09 |  | IEM Season X - gamescom |\n| 2015-07-16 | 2015-07-19 |  | IEM Season X - Shenzhen |\n| 2015-07-16 | 2015-07-17 |  | 2015 DreamHack Open: Valencia |\n| 2015-07-06 | 2015-07-12 |  | LOTTE Homeshopping 2015 KeSPA Cup Season 2 |\n| 2015-07-02 | 2015-07-05 |  | HomeStory Cup XI |", "question": "On the StarCraft II map Dash and Terminal, what feature makes expanding to the natural base challenging?", "options": ["The large open spaces", "The two smaller than average chokes", "The central mineral fields", "The abundance of rocks"], "answer": "The two smaller than average chokes"}

It allows the lifted building to become airborne and mobile, giving it a chance to relocate or escape hostile units. The speed of all buildings is 0.94.\n\n## Use\n\nPrimarily used in cooperation with add-ons for specific structures: For example, a Barracks can be enhanced with a Reactor while a Factory is under construction. Upon completion, both can be lifted and the Factory can land and take over the Reactor by landing at the Barrack's previous position.\nLift off can also be used to scout an enemy: A Barracks, being the cheapest among the buildings with this ability, can be flown across an enemy's main base during the early stages of the game.\nCan also be used to provide vision for Siege Tanks, which can shoot further than they can see. Barracks are cheaper (to repair) than any airbound unit while being sturdier.\nCommand Centers - which can load SCVs - or Orbital Commands are often lifted off and flown to seize expansions. Should an existing expansion be mined out, this can save resources for a new one.\nShould an overwhelming force attack an expansion or even the main base, lifting off and escaping can preserve a player's tech level and production capabilities. This grants a Terran player more freedom for the so-called \"Base Race\", where the two armies did not encounter each other: Instead of falling all the way back to defend, players \"race\" to be the first to destroy all hostile buildings and thereby winning the game. However, this is also known to often end in stalemates.\n\n## Notes\n\n- It is possible to land by and make use of both allied and enemy add-ons.\n\n- Enemy units, Zerg creep, and the Sentry ability Force Field prevents a building from landing.", "question": "Which of the following is NOT a reason to use the Lift off ability in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To relocate buildings to a new location", "To scout an enemy's base", "To provide vision for Siege Tanks", "To increase the attack speed of your units"], "answer": "To increase the attack speed of your units"}

{"document": "# Nuke Rush (vs. Zerg)\n## Counter Build for Zerg\n\nSimcity: By using Zerg buildings like Evolution Chambers and Roach Warren, Zerg can effectively block off Hellion harass. However, Hellion drops work against this strategy.\n\nSecret Expansion: The purpose of this build is to halve Zerg's economy, so any secret 3rd expansion negates this Ghost Build. Constant scout by Hellions can effectively end this strategy as well. Be very active with your Hellions!\n\n6 pool: Because Ghost Build gets second Supply Depot a bit slower than other builds, Zerg can exploit this by going all-in and bypass the choke before second Supply Depot has been built. Use early SCV scout to find 6 pool build and immediately build second Supply Depot, and you should be fine.\n\nFast Baneling: If Zerg can get Banelings before first 2 Hellions pop out, they can swarm through the wall and win very easily. This is why early SCV scout needs to see if Zerg is getting gas or expansion. Extra wall-in can deter this attack very well.\n\nNydus Worm: Similar to Baneling, you need to scout properly and see whether Zerg is going Baneling or Nydus, since two builds require completely different placement of Supply Depots. Spread your Supply Depots around your base to reveal fog of war.\n\n1-Hatchery Fast Muta: This build can make 5 or 6 Mutalisks extremely fast, leaving Terran no time to react at all. If your early scouting SCV does not see any expansion and even find early Lair-teching, get Engineering Bay as soon as possible and delay Ghost Build a bit, and place turrets on your mineral lines and production lines. Once you get 2 or 3 Ghosts, 5 or 6 Mutalisks will not be a problem with proper sniping. Do not forget to tighten your choke as well, as a lot of Zerglings will come with the Mutalisks.\n\nSpeed Overlord Scouting/Overlord Sacrifice: The success of this build depends on secrecy of Ghost Tech. Therefore it is crucial to hide the Ghost Academy as much as possible. Spread your Marines to see any incoming Overlord and take it out as soon as possible. Proxy-building your Ghost Academy may be a possible solution to this. Worst case scenario would be canceling nuke production and move to regular build with 1 or 2 Ghost as a support.", "question": "In the context of a Ghost Build against Zerg, what is the purpose of spreading Supply Depots around your base?", "options": ["To increase your supply cap", "To reveal the fog of war and scout for Nydus Worms", "To provide additional defense against Zerglings", "To speed up the production of Hellions"], "answer": "To reveal the fog of war and scout for Nydus Worms"}

The player must control a Forge before building Photon Cannons. It's more versatile than its Terran and Zerg counterparts as it can attack both air and ground units. Photon Cannons also serve as detectors with an extremely large vision range.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Photon Cannon can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. It can attack and serve as a detector only while it remains within the Matrix, otherwise it becomes unpowered and cannot function.\n\n## Abilities\n\nDetector\nRange: 11\nThe Photon Cannon is a Detector structure that can see cloaked, burrowed and hallucinated units.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\n### General\n\nWhen placing a Photon Cannon, a white ring appears along with the green ghost outline of the cannon. This ring indicates firing range only. The visual and detection range of the cannon is nearly 60% larger than the firing range. If you simply need detection around your mineral line or other area and not necessarily the attack capabilities a single cannon can easily supply vision for the mineral line against ranged attackers such as Ghosts and Banshees.\n\nPlayers typically will build Cannons in or around their mineral line to protect against (or, belatedly, to react to) harassment. In late stages of the game, expansion bases that the player deems difficult to readily defend will often be bolstered by a few Cannons as well.\n\nPhoton Cannons are used offensively in the relatively common Photon Cannon rush technique. Cannons deployed outside the player's own base can also be used offensively after the early stages of the game to deny or delay expansions.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nPhoton Cannons can be used to detect and therefore limit the effectiveness of Dark Templar as well as defend expansions later in the game as harass becomes more common.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nPhoton cannons can be used as a fallback detector if your Observers get picked off. This is critical as losing sight of cloaked Banshees or Ghosts can easily cost you the game.\n\nIn some cases Photon Cannons may be a more effective mineral sink than investing in Zealots, especially on defense. For example, Photon Cannons can take advantage of shooting from high ground, while you Force Field a ramp.\n\nThe range of the Ghost's Tac Nuke Strike is 10, while the vision range of the cannon is 11. The cannons can act as a good deterrent to nukes striking much deeper than your cannons for the cost of minerals only.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Photon Cannon can be used offensively in the beginning of the game. This is primarily done to kill/cancel a Zerg's natural expansion This can be used to:\n\n- Force the Zerg player to build Roaches along with Ravagers,Spine Crawlers to break the contain. Players can then opt for 2 ways, either just forcing a cancel on the Zerg base to set up their own, or commit further adding Shield Battery to make it harder for Zerg to break and go into a Robo for Immortals or Disruptors. Alternatively a player can also opt for Voidrays. Do keep in mind that Zerg has the ability to not break the contain and instead opt for a Nydus Worm instead to create a new expansion or to kill your base.\n\nCannons can also be used to help defend against Mutalisk harass along with shield batteries.", "question": "What is the primary advantage of using Photon Cannons for detection in StarCraft II?", "options": ["They can attack both air and ground units.", "They have a larger vision range compared to their firing range.", "They are cheaper to build than other detectors.", "They can be built without any special requirements."], "answer": "They have a larger vision range compared to their firing range."}

{"document": "# Worker split\n\nWorker splitting is a technique originating from StarCraft: Brood War to optimize the mineral mining of the initial workers.\n\nIn Brood War, as only a single worker can mine from a patch of minerals, sending your 4 initial workers to one patch leaves the other 3 idling until the first is done. Therefore, \"splitting\" your initial workers to mine from different patches greatly boosts your early-game income.\n\nIn SC2, the AI splits workers automatically and nearly optimally, yet some players continue to do it manually.\n\n## AI Split\n\nUpon sending a worker to a patch that is being mined from, StarCraft II's AI will automatically assign it to go mine from a patch that is not being mined from. Therefore, sending your initial 6 workers to a single patch will trigger the AI to automatically send the 5 remaining workers to other patches.\n\nThis is by far the easiest way to split, but a disadvantage is that you cannot assign workers to mine from the optimal patches. Also it is not the fastest way to start mining as workers will first touch upon the patch assigned by yourself before moving on to the next.\n\n## F1 Split\n\nPressing F1 will select one of your idle workers. By spamming F1 and right-click you can send all your workers to a separate mineral patch.\n\nThis way of splitting will allow you to select the optimal patches to be mined from and, as a result of splitting all your workers, mining will be a tad faster than the AI Split.\n\n## Splitting off\n\nThe most popular splitting method is splitting off. You send the initial 6 workers to get them moving. While they're moving you select some of the workers and send them to different patches - much like how it was done in StarCraft: Brood War. It is hard to do as the moving workers clump together - making it difficult to select individual ones. Popular alternatives are splitting 3 by 3, possibly splitting up on threesome further.\n\n## Additional Information\n\nFor an in-depth comparison between these three split methods, have a look at this thread from the TeamLiquid Forums: Worker splitting: Does it really matter?\n\nSC2 Split Timings", "question": "Which method of worker splitting allows you to manually select the optimal mineral patches to be mined from, potentially leading to faster mining compared to the AI Split?", "options": ["AI Split", "F1 Split", "Splitting off", "Worker splitting is not necessary in StarCraft II"], "answer": "F1 Split"}

{"document": "# 5 Barracks Reaper (vs. Zerg)\n## Execution\n### Pressure\n\nFirst Reaper\n\nGenerally by the time the first Reaper is out your scouting SCV has been killed, so you need to use this Reaper to scout as well. Immediately send the Reaper towards your opponents base and force back any Zerglings outside your base. At this point you want to confirm that that your opponent has an expansion or in the process of building one. You should not start harassing yet because the Zerg player will likely have Queens and a bunch of Zerglings.\nIf you see that the Zerg player is not expanding quickly (such as mass Zerglings or 1 hatch Roach) you have two choices; try to Bunker up his natural (trapping him inside his own base) or Bunker your own choke point.\n\nReaper Pressure\n\nOnce it has been confirmed that the Zerg player has an expansion, it is time to transition into the most important point of this strategy. Before moving on, you must know the technique of kiting with the Reapers when attacking.\n\nReaper Kiting Techniques\n\n- Attack button - Firstly send your Reapers away from the Zerg army, and when you want them to attack press A and left click anywhere in direction your units are running back. Once the Reaper has attacked move back and repeat.\n\n- Hold Position button - Firstly send your Reapers away from the Zerg army, and when you want them to attack press H. Once the Reaper has attacked move back and repeat.\n\nOnce you have your three Barracks up and running (two more should be currently building) and at least 4-5 Reapers it is time to put on the pressure. Your goal here is to force your opponent to sacrifice their economy as much as possible. Your opponent will likely to defend with Zerglings, Roaches and Queens. If you see Mutalisks your timing is likely to be off. Look for any openings inside the Zerg base (whether it is at their main base or expansion) and use the mobility of the Reapers to your advantage. Kill any stray units and keep forcing your opponent to go back and forth. Your goal here to keep picking off units, in particular Zerglings and Roaches.\n\nThe first rule is to only harass in areas where you can escape when the Zerg units arrive. This means do not move your Reapers into the back of your opponents base and do not go too far into creep. The second rule is to fight off creep because your Reapers can out maneuver the slower Zerg units. This means you need to initiate the fight on the creep and kite back towards the non creep area, while picking off enemy units.\n\nRemember to keep reinforcing your Reapers from the 5 Barracks. If you control your Reapers well, there will come a point in time when you will have a critical mass (generally 12+ Reapers). This means that Zerglings will become much less effective as they cannot get a surround on your Reapers. If you managed to dwindle your opponents forces down enough, there may be an opportunity to push in and finish the game. But even you do not manage to get the kill, it is possible to transition into the mid game with the advantage.\n\nSome numbers\n\n- Reapers need 2 hits to kill Zerglings.\n\n- Reapers need 3 hits to kill Drones.\n\n- Reapers need 19 hits to kill Queens.\n\n- Reapers need 20 hits to kill Roaches.\n\n- Reapers need 10 hits to kill a Spine Crawler.\n\n- Reapers need 42 hits to kill a Hatchery.", "question": "When executing the 5 Barracks Reaper strategy against Zerg, what is the correct technique for kiting with Reapers when attacking?", "options": ["Send your Reapers towards the Zerg army and hold position until they attack.", "Attack the Zerg army head-on with your Reapers and stay in one place to maximize damage.", "Send your Reapers away from the Zerg army, press H to hold position, attack, and then move back.", "Send your Reapers away from the Zerg army, press A and left click to attack, and then move back."], "answer": "Send your Reapers away from the Zerg army, press A and left click to attack, and then move back."}
{"document": "# 4 Warpgate Rush (Legacy of the Void)\n## Execution\n### PvZ\n\nIf you choose to use this build against a Zerg opponent, only prioritize Stalkers if you come up against Roaches or a heavy investment in Spine Crawlers. Otherwise, you will want to prioritize Adepts in order to deal with Zerglings.\n\nUtilising a two gas 4 Gate allows you to use more Sentries in your composition at the cost of Stalkers. The advantage of this is that it will allow you to block Zerg reinforcements by Force Fielding their main ramp; it also allows you to use Force Fields to trap Roaches against Zealots so that they cannot kite away from the Zealots, and to create artificial chokes for your units versus high numbers of Zerglings.\n\nAim to do significant economic damage by killing Drones, Queens, and the natural expansion. It is okay to accept losses to destroy a Hatchery, a tech building, or a number of Drones that are equal in cost to the units sacrificed to kill them.\n\nIf you manage to kill the natural expansion of the Zerg, do not over commit if the Zerg has their main base heavily defended. Don't be afraid to take an expansion in this situation as Zerg is at a large disadvantage if they have less bases than the Protoss player. In this situation, it can also be a good idea to set up a Force Field contain to delay the Zerg from retaking their natural expansion whilst you get your own set up.\n\nNo matter which variation you use, be careful of Zerglings sniping your Pylon or counter-attacking into your main-base.

{"document": "# 2 Base Templar (vs. Terran)\n## Scouting\n\nThe things you should be worried about are:\n\n- Is he going gasless expand, or did he take a gas?\n\n- Is he doing a 111 harassment opening like a Widow Mine drop, Hellion drop, or Cloaked Banshees, or is he rushing for Medivacs?\n\n- Did they do a greedy 3CC opening?\n\nBe aware of the timings at which any push might come. As a general rule, if they are including a reasonably fast CC (around 4:30), their push/drop will hit between the 8:00 and 8:30 minute mark. If they decide to delay his CC, they will attack at about 6:00 to 7:00.\n\nAs you scout, look for:\n\n- Gas vs no gas. If they open gasless, don’t get any defensive Cannons. Be aware that it’s possible to go for a 111 after fast expanding, but you should be able to see this with an Observer.\n\n- Reaper vs no Reaper: If they go for gas and don’t go Reaper, get one Cannon per mineral line.\n\n- Timing on the Command Centre: This is the crucial piece of info. If you don’t see a CC after about the 4:30 mark, get one Cannon per mineral line, as this is the biggest tell of a gas opening if you can't get a Probe in his base.\n\nYour build changes slightly to adapt to what the Terran is doing. If they go for 3 Barracks and Medivacs you should get a Sentry as your fourth Gateway unit and immediately get two extra Gateways. If your opponent attempts harassment, play more carefully. Get defensive Cannons before the extra Gateways as well as a Stalker instead of a second Sentry for some extra DPS. Keep the Mothership Core in the main grouped with an Observer if the Cannons are late, and be ready to use Photon Overcharge in the main while warping in extra reinforcements. Pull Probes away and let the Cannon and Photon Overcharge finish off any dropped Widow Mines/Marines/Hellions. At this stage you should be extremely careful with your forces. Do not pull your entire army in an attempt to snipe the Medivac or clear off the drop unless you know the units dropped are the only ones out on the map. A popular variation on Widow Mine drops is to delay the CC to get four Hellions and go for a run-by into the natural, hoping your army will be busy in the main. A single Cannon cannot take down all the Hellions before they roast half your Probes, which is why you need to play safely.

{"document": "# Adel's Late Gas (vs. Protoss)\n## Key Notes\n\n- Since you are utilizing a mineral disparity between you and your opponent as your advantage, you are going to want only a couple Sentries. You should have a ratio of about 3:3:1 of Zealot:Stalker:Sentry, until you add on additional Assimilators.\n\n- Your Photon Cannon is also essential for detecting Dark Templar, so place it where it has vision of your ramp so that you can Force Field the ramp and block any Dark Templar if necessary.\n\n- If you fail to deal significant damage with your first attack, you will need to either add on additional Cannons at your Natural Expansion, or skip the natural entirely.\n\n- Target either key Pylons powering multiple buildings or Probes with your initial attack. If your units are going to die no matter what (perhaps his Warp Gate finished while you were in your opponent's base and you failed to retreat in time), then use your army to kill their workers instead of directly engaging their army. Shooting their probes will delay future Warp Gate units from ever appearing!\n\n- If your opponent has Zealots focusing your Cannon, use a Force Field or two on your Cannon so that the Zealots end up ramming into the FFs, thus being a waste of minerals and damage momentarily.\n\n- Do not 9 Pylon scout, as this build should be safe against a 2 Gate (Adelscott states that it's safe against proxy 2 Gate in the VOD against White-Ra).

If the Protoss allows it you can cut an SCV for this and he'll have less Sentries when you engage.\n\n### Scouting\n\n## Execution\n\nMove out as soon as you have 5 Marines, your first Reaper should be close behind. Engage with this army, 1 Marauder and 2 more Marines should be on the way. Reaper control is key during the engagement - it has a number of roles to fill:\n\n- Vision: Hop the Reaper into the main to 1) see their army composition and 2) provide vision for your engaging Marines. See whether he has a Sentry or pure Stalker/Zealot.\n\n- Sentries: If the Protoss has a Sentry out focus fire first. The Reaper deals a good amount of damage to this Light unit (needs 5 shots) and killing it will leave the Protoss without Guardian Shield/Force Field.\n\n- Worker Harass: When there are no more Sentries, run the Reaper to his mineral line. If you can split his forces to deal with it, your Marines coming up the ramp will have an easier time taking out what forces he has left.\n\nWork towards the Mineral line with your Marine/Marauder, taking out quickly any Protoss forces while trying to keep your Reaper alive. Stim should be done around the time your second Marauder arrives. Run your Reaper away when under attack (direction should be not towards your forces) and attack Probes with it when it's not. Good multitasking will make this build and first engagement all the more effective.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nMuch of the adaptation lies in the attack's execution. As it happens so early in the game only Gateway units will, normally, be out. Versus a super fast Robo or Stargate you can still go for the Probes and kill a decent amount of them while preparing defences at home. \nIf you successfully put some pressure on, this build will allow you to either add raxes and keep on the pressure or expand. Defend an expansion with Bunkers as needed and keep adding raxes or Tech to Medivacs.\n\n## Maps\n\nSince the Reaper is such a linchpin in this attack, the map needs to be good for it.

{"document": "# 1 Rax Marauder (vs. Protoss)\n## Execution\n### Micro\n\nThe opening phase of this build may demand an intense level of micromanagement in order to properly harass the Protoss once Stalkers are discovered. Because it is impossible to kite them, as Marauders and Stalkers have the same range, it is advisable to play conservatively once the Protoss reveals his Stalkers until the Concussion Shells have finished researching, at which point it is imperative to chase the Protoss forces deeper into their main. On top of that, the Protoss may build a Zealot to perform the same duty as your SCV: a human shield. Such a situation will make micromanagement much more involved.\n\nIf the Protoss Stalkers outnumber the Marauders when Concussion Shells have finished, it is advisable to abandon the harassment and setup a containment whilst still producing Marauders to make up for the lack of numbers. It is unlikely that the Protoss will pressure outward at this point when he realizes that the Concussion Shells will prevent him from retreating without losing too many of his forces. If your opponent notices that they have a significant number advantage over your remaining Marauders, though, your opponent will most likely force you to retreat to your base and take map control from you.\n\nAlso, note that it is important to keep the scouting SCV alive — preferably at full health — so that it can serve as a shield (because the AI will target SCVs before Marauders in many situations if not directly told to attack the Marauders) for the initial Marauder harassment, thus prolonging the lives of the Marauders and making them more cost-effective. If the scouting SCV dies, cut an SCV from the mineral line to join the first Marauder on the way to the Protoss main.\n\nLastly, it is a good idea to retreat your Marauders temporarily when reinforcements are arriving from the Barracks so that you can continue the harassment with even more forces.", "question": "When should you abandon harassment and set up containment in the 1 Rax Marauder build against Protoss?", "options": ["When your Marauders outnumber the Protoss Stalkers", "When the Protoss has not built any Zealots", "When Concussion Shells have finished and the Protoss Stalkers outnumber your Marauders", "When your SCV scout is at full health"], "answer": "When Concussion Shells have finished and the Protoss Stalkers outnumber your Marauders"}

Burrow allows for quick health regeneration, and the speed upgrade along with creep will keep the opponent's ground forces occupied long enough for reinforcements, or for a different unit response if needed.\n\nBuilding an additional Overlord is also important to have enough free supply to build 7 Roaches. Economic Roach defenses are after the second Hatchery is started, and should have an early Lair for fast Roach speed and Burrow upgrades and, with good Creep spread, can hold off any ground-based early pressure.\n\nRoach Feints against Protoss, starting a Roach Warren while the scout is still in base and cancelling or making minimumal Roaches is useful for misguiding the Protoss early builds at higher levels.

It is okay to accept losses to destroy a Hatchery, a tech building, or a number of Drones that are equal in cost to the units sacrificed to kill them.\n\n- If you manage to kill the natural expansion of the Zerg, do not over commit if the Zerg has their main base heavily defended. Don't be afraid to take an expansion in this situation as Zerg is at a large disadvantage if they have less bases than the Protoss player. In this situation, it can also be a good idea to set up a Force Field contain to delay the Zerg from re-taking their natural expansion whilst you get your own set up.\n\n- No matter which variation you use, be careful of Zerglings sniping your Pylon or counter-attacking into your main base. It is often a good idea to fully wall-off your main base with an additional Pylon when you move out to place down proxy Pylons as Zergling run-bys will very quickly lose you the game.", "question": "When executing a Warpgate Rush against a Zerg opponent in StarCraft II, what should you prioritize if the Zerg invests heavily in Roaches or Spine Crawlers?", "options": ["Zealots", "Sentries", "Stalkers", "High Templars"], "answer": "Stalkers"}

One MULE and one SCV gather from the same mineral patch simultaneously.\n\nThe Mobile Utility Lunar Excavator (MULE) is a temporary unit that can mine minerals and repair for the Terran forces. MULEs are called down from the Orbital Command at the cost of 50 energy. They last 64 seconds of game time. If the MULE is cast on a mineral patch it will begin to mine minerals as soon as it spawns. Despite their timed life and Orbital Command energy cost, a MULE has several advantages over an SCV. A MULE costs no supply. MULEs have a mining time 2.05x longer than an SCV, but have the same movement speed and acceleration. MULEs carry 5 times more minerals per trip than an SCV on normal minerals, gathering 25 minerals per trip on all types of mineral patches. On both far and close mineral patches, a MULE will return its cargo nine times providing the player with 225 (25x9) minerals before the MULE expires. On the closest mineral patches, the mule will actually complete mining 10  times but will die before returning to the command center, resulting in 25 minerals being destroyed completely. To prevent this, the player has to either micro the MULE to not mine the 10th cargo or simply deploy it at one of the farther mineral patches, as MULEs will not complete mining their 10th cargo on the farther mineral patches.\n\nMULEs are as effective as around 3.45 SCVs on near patches and 3.94 SCVs on far patches, as SCVs average 61.22 minerals per minute on near blue mineral patches and 53.57 minerals per minute on far blue mineral patches (for two or less workers per patch).\n\nCalldown: Extra Supplies\nCaster: Orbital Command 50\nDuration: 3 s\nThe Orbital Command calls down additional supplies which permanently increase a Supply Depot's supply limit by 8.\n\nCalldown: Extra Supplies calls down additional supplies which permanently increase a Supply Depot's supply limit by 8.

{"document": "# Stalker (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nStalkers are generally strong in the PvP matchup due to their speed, durability, and micro capability compared to other Gateway units. An early swarm of Stalkers is the goal of most Gateway heavy openers in PvP. A mass of offensive Stalkers in an early attack, around 4:00 or even earlier, can be extremely difficult for a Protoss opponent to deal with provided they do not open with a Robotics Facility.\n\nStalkers are also highly favoured against harassment, particularly against Adepts due to their armored tag and higher ranged damage, even though the Stalkers do not gain their movement ability until the Twilight Council is constructed. Additionally, the anti-air capabilities of the Stalker can prove critical when dealing with Stargate strategies including Phoenix and Oracle harassment as well as Void Ray rushes. Blink and Shield Batteries can help enhance Stalker survivability against Void Rays as required.\n\nHowever, for all their advantages Stalkers cost a significant amount of gas and delay tech rushes: even 2-3 Stalkers will cost as much as a tech structure and delay construction by up to a minute, and sustained Stalker production will effectively lock the player out of gas-heavy Stargate compositions. It may be worth considering spending the Warpgate cycles on Zealots or Adepts instead to simply save gas, ensuring that tech structures can be obtained on time.\n\nIn later stages of the game, Stalkers with Blink can provide additional mobility and harassment, but they  will struggle against the almost inevitable Immortal-based army in the Protoss mirror match-up. Immortals fire faster and have higher bonus damage against armored, dealing about three times the damage for only twice the gas cost.

{"document": "# Zatic Build (vs. Protoss)\n\nZatic Build\nTwo Reactors\nStrategy Information\nCreator(s):zatic\nMatchups:TvP\nType:Opening\nPopularized by:zatic\n\n## Overview\n\nThe \"Zatic Build\" was one of the first, maybe the first build to be coined in SC II. It can roughly be compared to the FD in BW. The main goal of this build is to get an expansion up by pushing the Protoss back, not to kill the opponent. The build is still strong enough to punish greedy Protoss and can cause damage and set the Protoss back if they are caught off guard.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 9 - Supply at Choke; 10/11 - First Barracks at Choke, place carefully (an addon needs to fit); 11 - Gas; 1 Marine, kill Scout; ~14 - second Barracks; Supply Depot completing wall, or:; @25 Gas - build Tech Lab addon at the first Barracks, completing the wall-in; Take 1 SCV off gas; Marauder; Reactor addon at the second Barracks as soon as second rax finishes; Take 1 SCV off gas |\n\n- 9 - Supply at Choke\n\n- 10/11 - First Barracks at Choke, place carefully (an addon needs to fit)\n\n- 11 - Gas\n\n- 1 Marine, kill Scout\n\n- ~14 - second Barracks\n\n- Supply Depot completing wall, or:\n\n- @25 Gas - build Tech Lab addon at the first Barracks, completing the wall-in\n\n- Take 1 SCV off gas\n\n- Marauder\n\n- Reactor addon at the second Barracks as soon as second rax finishes\n\n- Take 1 SCV off gas\n\nBuild constant Marauders from the first Barracks, constant Marines from the second. With 3 Marauders, 5-7 Marines and 2 SCV, launch your first attack. \nYou will have 400 minerals about half way into the map, so build a CC instantly.\n\n## Engaging the Protoss\n\n- Take care of your SCVs! Unlike in BW, SCVs in front will get auto-targeted by the AI very quickly and they will in fact die first. You want to keep them though to make a Bunker if the opportunity is there.\n\n- Beware of probes! Your ranged units, especially the Marauders, get murdered surprisingly easily by pulled Probes. Do not get yourself trapped in a corner in the opponents base, the worker auto surround AI is very good and you will not be able to move in seconds when surrounded by Probes.\n\n- Targeting: If you face Zealots / Stalker, dodge the Zealots and target the Stalkers. There is a lot you can do additionally with your Marauders, like individually target Zealots to slow them down, then resume fire on Stalkers. This just needs practice.\n\n## Pulling back\n\nThis build is supposed to get your expansion up. Do not over commit!\n\n- If you see a 2 or even 3 Gate opening, pull back once you reached the P base. Against 3 Gate, get a Bunker at your natural as well. You only have to survive and you will have the game.\n\n- Against a quick-teching Protoss, this opening is the most effective. You should be able to break the ramp easily against 1 gate openings and the attack will hit before any of the tech of Protoss is available. Try to do as much damage as possible, but pull back again once they pull Probes.\n\n- Use an SCV to build a Bunker at their natural and put your remaining units in there.\n\n- Against a fast Nexus, try to get that Bunker up! Again, priority number 1 is not to lose your SCV, so keep them in the back when engaging.\n\n## Transitioning\n\nThe main goal of this build is to get your expansion up and to get ahead in economy. Once you have your expansion, the build can transition into almost any tech path you want to choose. Just make sure you get your detection up quickly after you expansion against a teching Protoss and get the Orbital Command as soon as possible after.\n\nA viable option is the mass Marauder with Ghost and EMP followup, since you have the 2 Barracks already. Obviously this depends on the opponent's choice, but against a pure ground army in the early midgame this is a deadly combination. This is a very common transition as Protoss often respond with an Immortal Rush. Due to the cost of Ghosts, if you are considering this transition, it is suggested that you do not take the SCVs off gas.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- Zatic Build by zatic.", "question": "In the Zatic Build, what is the recommended action when engaging Protoss Zealots and Stalkers?", "options": ["Target the Zealots first", "Dodge the Zealots and target the Stalkers", "Engage both equally", "Focus on the Protoss economy instead"], "answer": "Dodge the Zealots and target the Stalkers"}
{"document": "# Muta/Ling/Bane (vs. Terran)\n## Overview\n\nMuta/Ling/Bane is a mid-game and late-game strategy that involves using Mutalisks to harass and contain Terran while you take additional bases and build up a large army consisting of Mutalisks, Zerglings, and Banelings.\n\nThis army is good because it is extremely mobile and each part of the army covers the weaknesses of the rest of the army.  Marines are the most cost-effective counter to Mutalisks, and so the Banelings are there to counter the large amounts of Marines that Terran will have to make; Zerglings and Mutalisks are good for cleaning up the reminds of a push after Banelings.  In addition, Thors are very good against Mutalisks, and Siege Tanks are very good against Banelings.  Therefore, there are also Zerglings present in order to deal with these counters.\n\nThe Mutalisk is the work-horse of this strategy as it has to:\n\n- Harass the opposing economy.\n\n- Spot and deal with drops\n\n- And stay in large enough number to hold air control.\n\nMuta/Ling/Bane is very powerful and is largely responsible for the shaping the current state of the ZvT/TvZ match-up to what it is today.  In particular, Muta/Ling/Bane caused MMM to become largely obsolete in TvZ, and caused a shift towards the now-standard army of Marine and Siege Tank.", "question": "In the Muta/Ling/Bane strategy, which unit is primarily used to counter large amounts of Marines that Terran might produce?", "options": ["Mutalisks", "Zerglings", "Banelings", "Hydralisks"], "answer": "Banelings"}

{"document": "# Terran\n\nThe Terrans are relative newcomers to the Koprulu sector. They are the descendents of a disastrous colonization expedition launched from Earth centuries ago. Its human cargo made up of dissidents and malcontents the ruling Earth government deemed expendable. The survivors of the expedition established three colonies that became the basis for the major power blocs in Terran space: the Confederacy, the Kel-Morian Combine, and the Umojan Protectorate. The corrupt Confederacy was overthrown by terrorist and revolutionary Arcturus Mengsk during the chaos of the Zerg invasion. Now the Terran Dominion has emerged from the ashes of the old Confederacy as the dominant power, ruled by none other than Emperor Arcturus I.\n\nForced to adapt to the harsh existence on the mostly lifeless worlds of the sector, the Terrans are masters of survival. With neither the advanced technology of the Protoss nor the natural prowess of the Zerg to rely on, the Terran military forces consist of a varied mix of units. From basic but effective infantry like the Marines to heavily armed Battlecruisers, Terran units rely on solid armor, plentiful firepower and strength in numbers to hold the line.

A Warp Prism also gives an early Warpgate research timing for Adepts if the opponent has teched too hard or too greedy.\n\n- Compared to the Stalker, the other ranged Gateway unit, the Adept tends to do better in the early game with its bonus against light units and low gas cost, whereas the Stalker does better in the midgame because it is more durable and can hit air units, amongst other reasons.\n\n- For example, Adepts combine well with the Sentry's Forcefield ability for defense against Ground unit rushes, due to the Adept's lower gas cost.  It may be possible to defend off of Gateways alone, depending on the size of the ramp you wish to defend.  This effect is enhanced when Warpgate research is finished and was used in Wings of Liberty against a Stalker-based 4 Warpgate Rush to buy time for Immortals.\nHowever, Adepts still cost less gas than stalkers, and as always Adepts may still be used to supplement other Robotics Facility or especially Stargate play.\n\n- However, Adepts still cost less gas than stalkers, and as always Adepts may still be used to supplement other Robotics Facility or especially Stargate play.", "question": "Which unit is better against light units in the early game and has a lower gas cost compared to the Stalker?", "options": ["Zealot", "Stalker", "Adept", "Sentry"], "answer": "Adept"}

{"document": "# 2 Base Templar (vs. Terran)\n## Midgame Transition\n\nOnce your natural is well saturated, take the gasses there; normally this is at around the seven minute mark as with most PvT builds. From here, go up to two Sentries and then start teching up to Charge and High Templar whilst making sure to keep your upgrades going. During this time, the Terran will start their midgame pressure as they take their third. Against a Medivac push, follow this build:\n\n| vs. a Medivac Push |\n| --- |\n| Units off the Robo: 2x Observer, 1x Warp Prism, 1x Observer; @50% +1 Armour: Twilight Council; @~8:45: Gateways 4 and 5; @100% Twilight Council: Charge and +2 Armour; @150 Minerals, 200 Gas: Templar Archives; @100% Templar Archives: Warp in 2 Templar and start Psionic Storm; @~9:50: Gateways 6 and 7; Take A Third Nexus Once You Deflect Pressure; Add One Observer For A Total Of 4. |\n|  |\n\n- Units off the Robo: 2x Observer, 1x Warp Prism, 1x Observer\n\n- @50% +1 Armour: Twilight Council\n\n- @~8:45: Gateways 4 and 5\n\n- @100% Twilight Council: Charge and +2 Armour\n\n- @150 Minerals, 200 Gas: Templar Archives\n\n- @100% Templar Archives: Warp in 2 Templar and start Psionic Storm\n\n- @~9:50: Gateways 6 and 7\n\n- Take A Third Nexus Once You Deflect Pressure\n\n- Add One Observer For A Total Of 4.\n\nAssuming you are playing against a Medivac timing, rally the Warp Prism across the map. Warp in four Zealots with it and drop them in their main slightly after seeing them move out, when his army is about one third of the way across the map. This move is essential, as it buys time for Storm, +2 Armour and your extra Gateways to kick in.\n\nIn Wings of Liberty it was impossible to hold a Medivac timing if you went for Storm, a Robotics Facility, and upgrades at the same time. However, with the added DPS of Photon Overcharge you can be greedier, getting a (slightly) faster Storm and pressuring with the Warp Prism while still being able to defend thanks to Feedback and an Archon.\n\nIf they try to commit to their Medivac timing whilst ignoring the Zealots in his main, you should defend with Chargelot/Archon plus the Nexus cannon, trying to Feedback the Medivacs before morphing the Archon. If they do this, they're going to lose add-ons, SCVs, and reinforcements to your dropped Zealots. Zealots are incredibly strong if the Terran doesn’t micro against them, which will be hard for them to do if they're trying to fight on two different fronts. Depending on the map layout, it might be easier or harder to get Zealots into the mineral line. If you can’t hit it easily you can still go after add-ons or key buildings like Armories and Engineering Bays. Taking out the Reactor on his Starport is particularly strong, but Reactors on Barracks and SCVs are good targets as well.\n\nIf instead they are going Mech or 3CC, you can be greedy and take your third off three Gates before getting the additional Gateways. If they are playing greedy, try to match their greed: cut units briefly for production facilities and a second Forge instead of making a defensive army that won’t be useful when they aren’t going to push. You still want to get a Warp Prism out eventually, but you don’t need it as fast. Get Observers in position first, increase your Templar count, and start Immortal production if they go Mech.\n\nYour Observer's jobs are the following:\n\n- The first Observer scouts the Terran's base and army.\n\n- The second Observer scouts for a fast Medivac drop in your main while your army defends your natural.\n\n- The third Observer checks for any push at your natural.\n\n- The fourth Observer checks for any drops on your natural, and later on for pushes at your third.\n\n- (Optional) The fifth Observer checks for drops to your third and/or pushes at a key location; this is somewhat map dependent.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Warp Prism in the strategy against a Medivac timing push?", "options": ["To drop Zealots in the Terran's main base", "To harass the Terran's mineral line", "To defend against incoming air units", "To scout the Terran's base and army"], "answer": "To drop Zealots in the Terran's main base"}

{"document": "# Extractor Trick\n\nTo read about the Brood War equivalent, see Extractor Trick.\n\nThe Extractor trick allows you to build a unit over your supply cap. This is performed by using a Drone to create an Extractor, which is the cheapest structure. Doing so frees up one supply, so you can build another unit (usually another Drone). Finally, cancel the Extractor to get your drone back. Since an Extractor costs 25 minerals, the cancellation fee is only 6 minerals.\n\nDoing this trick is considered economically inferior to a standard 9 Overlord.\n\n## Build Order\n\nThe basic Extractor trick is as follows:\n\n- Drones until 10/10\n\n- 10/10 - Extractor\n\n- 9/10 - Drone\n\n- 10/10 - Cancel Extractor > 11/10\n\n## Use\n\nThe Extractor trick is most commonly used to make an additional drone just before or after the first Overlord is produced; the exact timings will depend on the specific build. Doing this gives your economy a slight boost in the early stages of the game.\n\nHowever, the extra unit can be used for other purposes such as scouting, making an Extractor at your opponent's base to slow their gas down, to place a natural expansion, or to use it for certain aggressive builds currently in the game.\n\n### Double/Triple Extractor Trick\n\nSome players have designed builds in which you morph 2/3 drones into Extractors in order to go negative 2/3 in supply, respectively. For example, in a game at MLG Raleigh, CatZ uses the triple Extractor trick in order to get out some fast Zerglings for some unexpected quick pressure.\n\n## Efficiency\n\nWhether the economical gain weighs up to the 6 mineral cancellation fee depends on the specific build. Some players use it to keep their fingers busy [1], but thanks to Skrag [2], the data has been spaded. The findings are below.\n\n### Skrag's Post\n\nThe 9 Overlord is the best economic build, period. Minerals at 2:15: 370\n\n10 Overlord can be used for 10pool and overpool, but is inferior to 9OL in every other possible respect to the tune of 10 minerals, and loses the small window of advantage it gets by building the 10th drone sooner by the time 10OL finishes its 11th worker. Minerals at 2:15: 355\n\nA single Extractor trick doing the trick before building the Overlord (11 drones then Overlord) gives a small time window of about a 15 mineral advantage, between workers 11 and 14, but there is a cost, of around 5-10 minerals. Best case, you *might* be able to break even when compared to 9OL, but most of the time you'll lose 5-10 minerals. Minerals at 2:15: 364\n\nSingle Extractor trick after the Overlord (10 drones, Overlord, trick to 11 drones) is inferior to 10-T-OL in the 11-13 worker range, and is inferior to 9OL in the 14-15 range, so I honestly see no reason to ever trick this way, UNLESS you meant to 9OL, but forgot the Overlord. In that case, this is your best way to try to catch back up, because the cost is 0-5 minerals instead of 5-10. Minerals at 2:15: 369\n\nThe double Extractor trick provides such a small advantage over the single Extractor trick during even a smaller window that it should probably only be used exactly to 12 pool, and even then, there is an extra cost over the single Extractor trick. It probably compares to the single Extractor trick much like 10OL compares to 9OL, meaning that if you're doing something exactly on drone 12, you might use it, otherwise, the single trick is probably strictly superior. Minerals at 2:15: 353 (imprecise, but again, likely strictly inferior to single trick except for fastest 12pool)\n\nAlternative considerations\n\nMore drones earlier to defend against fast rush as well as improved utilization of the initial Hatchery Larvae.\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ Sheth's ZvP guide\n\n- ↑ 9OL vs 10OL vs Extractor Tricks revisited (again)", "question": "What is the primary purpose of using the Extractor trick in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To create an additional unit just before or after the first Overlord is produced, giving a slight economic boost", "To scout the opponent's base", "To place a natural expansion", "To slow down the opponent's gas production"], "answer": "To create an additional unit just before or after the first Overlord is produced, giving a slight economic boost"}

{"document": "# Resources\n## Mining Rates\n### Minerals\n\nA worker occupies a mineral field for 1.99 seconds. It then pauses for approximately 0.3571 seconds before returning at full speed. The next worker can already begin operations during the pause. This applies equally to normal minerals and gold minerals.\nIn theory, a fully saturated mineral line with 8 mineral fields can therefore mine no more than 1206.03 minerals per minute (60sec / 1.99sec * 5 minerals * 8 mineral fields). The corresponding number for a fully saturated Rich mineral line with 6 mineral fields is 1266.33 minerals per minute (60sec / 1.99sec * 7 minerals * 6 mineral fields). However, due to workers commuting between mineral fields in search for one that is not occupied, these ideal numbers are never reached.\n\nWith two workers per mineral patch, a large mineral field with 1800 minerals will exhaust after 15 minutes, whilst a small field with 900 minerals will exhaust in 7.5 minutes. The corresponding numbers for Rich mineral fields are approx. 11 minutes and 5.5 minutes, respectively. Note that these numbers do not take into consideration Terran MULEs.\n\nMULEs can mine while other SCVs are mining, but only a single MULE can mine a mineral field at one time. Their time occupying a field is longer than a worker. The effective mining rate of MULEs is approximately 3.45 times that of a SCV's on near patches and approximately 3.94 times that of a SCV's on far patches. MULEs mine 225 minerals on both near and far mineral fields, although when mining near mineral fields they drop 25 minerals since their timed life will run out while returning cargo. With MULEs, Terran can mine patches faster than any other race and can maintain similar levels of mineral income with less secured patches for mining, thereby compensating for their worse production capabilities.", "question": "How long does it take for a large mineral field with 1800 minerals to be exhausted with two workers per mineral patch?", "options": ["5.5 minutes", "7.5 minutes", "11 minutes", "15 minutes"], "answer": "15 minutes"}

{"document": "# Ravager\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nIf a Protoss player tries to block his ramp using Force Fields, the Ravager can destroy it using Corrosive Bile. As a result, Sentries are less common in ZvP, except in early timing attacks with other basic Gateway units.\n\nRavagers are commonly seen in this matchup in many different areas. First off, they are good at holding early-mid game attacks, since they are generally composed mostly of the new Adept. Ravagers can stay out of range of the Adept and kite them with their Corrosive Bile ability and superior range. Ravagers are generally good against Protoss throughout the game, since the Protoss army tends to clump up, and the Ravager can easily increase the damage of the Zerg's army either by landing the bile ability or using it to force units to move, making them waste time that they could use to attack the enemy army.\n\nA new strategy that involves Ravagers is a Zergling style that focuses on quick double upgrades into Ultralisks with Ravagers for supporting damage. If the Zerg player surrounds the Protoss army with Zerglings, Ravagers can melt the Protoss ball, since they cannot dodge the shots while they are surrounded. They are also found in Roach/Hydra forces since the bile can force the Protoss army to make unfavorable movements depending on where it is placed.\n\nDespite Ravagers having greater speed than stimmed Marines on creep, they are the prime target of Disruptors. They have a much bigger size and collision which makes them hard to dodge the Disruptor's Purification Nova. If they are fighting against disruptors outside of creep, their base speed makes it even worse to dodge the novas. Corrosive Biles also take a longer time to hit the target point compared to the novas, which makes the engagement hard from the Zerg side which tends to dodge the balls all the time without dealing any damage back to the Protoss army.", "question": "In the Zerg versus Protoss matchup, why are Ravagers particularly effective against Protoss units?", "options": ["Because they can quickly upgrade into Ultralisks.", "Because they can force Protoss units to clump up, increasing the effectiveness of Corrosive Bile.", "Because they have a shorter cooldown on their Corrosive Bile ability.", "Because they are immune to the Protoss's Force Field ability."], "answer": "Because they can force Protoss units to clump up, increasing the effectiveness of Corrosive Bile."}

Missile Turrets require an Engineering Bay in order to be constructed, which also has upgrades for the Missile Turret: Hi-Sec Auto Tracking and Building Armor.\n\nThe Missile Turret's attack is about as powerful as four Marines. The twin attack (12x2) makes it less effective against high armor targets such as Battlecruisers but despite this setback, Missile Turrets still deal more DPS per cost than the Photon Cannon or Spore Crawler. Although they cannot out-range Carriers, the Missile Turret's high damage and endurance is still very potent for clearing out Interceptors.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nA few well placed Missile Turrets can fend off Banshee harass in the early game. Since a Missile Turret can detect farther than it can shoot, it is still useful when the Cloaked Banshee is out of range. A small group of stimmed Marines can run up to a detected Banshee and shoot it down if the opposing player does not pull back immediately.\n\nTurrets are also commonly used in conjunction with Siege Tanks to fortify a position. When deployed in the field, they can assist Vikings in the air battle or  detect cloaked Banshees and Ghosts.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nA handful of Missile Turrets can effectively hold off large numbers of Mutalisks and is recommended for protecting your vulnerable SCVs. When under attack, your SCVs can repair the Missile Turrets, increasing its longevity. However, this guarantees that  the Mutalisk's Glaive Worm attack will bounce from the Missile Turret onto the SCVs.\n\nThe Missile Turret is also able to spot burrowed Infestors and Roaches, which can prevent a potentially disastrous sneak attack on your mineral lines.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nMissile Turrets can minimize damage taken from Dark Templar, and can also be used to ward off Phoenix harass. They are decent against uncharged, lone Void Ray attacks, but fall extremely quickly to multiple charged Void Rays.

When moving out to the center of the map, controlling the two Watch Towers on your half of the map will make securing future expansions much easier.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- There are four Xel'Naga Towers located in center of the map, covering all ground attack paths.\n\n- Destructible rock prevents access to the fourth expansion.\n\n### GSL Akilon Flats\n\nAkilon Flats have been added to the map pool for the 2013 GSL Season 1, with the following changes:[3]\n\n- Neutral supply depots have been added to the bottom of the ramp of the main base.\n\n- Destructible rocks have had their health lowered to 1000.\n\n- The Xel'Naga watchtowers in the center area will lose power for the rest of the game after 7 minutes.\n\n### KeSPA Akilon Flats\n\nAkilon Flats has been added to the map pool for Round 3 of the 2012-2013 Proleague, with the following changes from the ladder version:[4]\n\n- Neutral Supply depot at the ramp.\n\n- Creep color has been tweaked a little.\n\n## Strategies\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Akilon Flats15134161847.1%42261661.9%31151648.4%12923\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Akilon Flats | 151 | 34 | 16 | 18 | 47.1% | 42 | 26 | 16 | 61.9% | 31 | 15 | 16 | 48.4% | 12 | 9 | 23 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2013-01-062013-03-092013 Global StarCraft II League Season 1\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2013-01-06 | 2013-03-09 |  | 2013 Global StarCraft II League Season 1 |", "question": "What happens to the Xel'Naga watchtowers in the center area after 7 minutes in the GSL version of Akilon Flats?", "options": ["They gain additional power", "They lose power for the rest of the game", "They become indestructible", "They provide extra resources"], "answer": "They lose power for the rest of the game"}
{"document": "# Changeling (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Changeling is a temporary Zerg unit spawned by an Overseer that lasts for 107 seconds. The Changeling spawns as a Zerg-looking unit, but upon seeing an enemy unit or building it will automatically transform into the basic unit of that enemy's race (Marine, Zergling, or Zealot). If the enemy player has researched Combat Shield for Marines or Metabolic Boost for Zerglings, then the Changeling will also copy the upgraded models for those units. The Changeling will not gain the new model if the enemy player researches one of those upgrades after the Changeling has already morphed.\n\nOnce disguised, the Changeling takes on the enemy's own color and will no longer be automatically attacked by the enemy's units, allowing it to infiltrate enemy territory unsuspected. Changelings cannot be discerned as impostors by any form of detection, nor will the secondary effects of EMP Round reveal their true allegiance. Likewise, a Sensor Tower's Radar ability will not identify the Changeling as hostile after it has morphed. However, if the opponent selects the Changeling, they will be unable to give it orders (since it is not theirs) and the word \"Changeling\" will appear in place of the unit type that it appears to be. In the event that an opponent does not spot a Changeling joining their army, it will often be revealed when they notice that it doesn't have a selection circle around it when they box their army. This can be slightly mitigated by ordering the Changeling to follow the unit it is disguised as within an army, so that it won't be noticed when the army is moved.\n\nDisguised Changelings can only be killed by manually forcing units to attack it (right-clicking on it will issue an Attack command) or waiting for its timer to elapse.  Note that the Changeling's Disguise ability is only triggered within a range of 12 and only if vision is provided for it, as the Changeling itself features a sight range of just 8. Units that are \"hidden\" to the Changeling (e.g. unspotted units on a cliff or cloaked units) will easily dispatch of it in its native form. Also, note that Siege Tanks can attack up to a distance of 13 and thus can automatically kill an unmorphed Changeling before it can get in range to disguise itself.\n\nSome properties of the Changeling change after it disguises itself. Changelings disguised as Zerglings will move at the speed of a slow Zergling and get a speed multiplier from Creep, though they do not benefit from any player's Metabolic Boost upgrade even if they appear to have wings. Changelings disguised as Marines or Zealots have the sight range of the copied unit, increasing their sight to 9. Finally, Changelings disguised as Zealots will appear to lose their shields to an EMP Round, but will begin regaining them immediately at a rate of 0.5 points per second. This is in contrast to real Protoss units, which will not begin regaining their shields for 10 seconds and will regain them at 2 points per second.", "question": "What happens to a Changeling disguised as a Zealot when hit by an EMP Round?", "options": ["It loses its disguise.", "It loses its shields but regains them immediately at a rate of 0.5 points per second.", "It is instantly destroyed.", "It gains additional armor."], "answer": "It loses its shields but regains them immediately at a rate of 0.5 points per second."}

{"document": "# Macro\n## Race-Specific Mechanics\n### Terran\n\nAfter upgrading the Command Center with an Orbital Command, Terrans can choose between three options, each for 50 Energy:\n\n- Calldown: MULE - An improved SCV is dropped at a chosen location and can mine minerals at roughly 4-4.5x the rate of a normal SCV or repair for 90 seconds. This ability is especially useful in the early game.\n\n- Scanner Sweep - Reveals a certain area of the map and uncovers cloaked units. Important to note that the actual reveal area is much larger than the animation's radius.\n\n- Calldown: Extra Supplies - Instantly increases the supply yield of a selected supply depot by 8. This is good for when you become supply blocked, allowing you to continue to produce units to fuel a \"ball\", fend off an attack on your base, or forego the build time in certain situations (see TLO's supply drop fast expo build)\n\n- Forgetting to MULE as soon as you have 50 energy results in lost opportunity cost. But even if you forget, your MULEs will still mine you the same amount of minerals. It is the opportunity that is lost since you could have had those minerals earlier. Arguably, in lower leagues forgetting to MULE ASAP is not as bad as forgetting to Warp in units or forgetting to inject larvae, considering that only the opportunity cost is permanently lost.\n\n- Pressing Tab while having selected multiple types of building producing structures will cycle through them (same for unit types). However, Tabbing is not always necessary, If you have regular Barracks, a Tech Lab Barracks, and a Reactor Barracks selected, click A for Marine will be prioritized to be made at the Reactor Barracks, regular Barracks, and then finally the Tech Lab.

Though Marauders may be needed to stop Roach-Rushes.\n\n## Goal\n\nMass-produce Hellions off of two Factories to pressure Hatchery-Tech units and make for more opportunities to attack Zerg's mineral lines. Making for a more secure low-ground expansion and time for Thor production to counter Mutalisks, probably into a Siege Tank push but more likely for double Armory upgrades to make for a stronger push timing while having the Hellions to push into the Zerg's base, and make the usual ability to mass large Zergling/Baneling forces null.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n{{build\n|\n\n- 10 - Supply Depot\n\n- 12 - Barracks\n\n- 13 - Refinery\n\n- 15 - Orbital Command Upgrade\n\n- 15 - [[Marine] (1 only)\n\n- 16 - Supply Depot\n\n- 17 - Factory\n\n- 19 - Reactor on Barracks > Switch to the Factory (1)\n\n- 20 - Command Center (2)\n\n- 22 - Supply Depot + Hellions\n\n- 27 - Factory (2) + Reactor (2) on Barracks > Switch to Factory (2)\n\n- 37 - Orbital Command (2) Upgrade + Armory (1)\n\n## Scouting\n\n- Pressure is scouting.\n\n- Roach Warren? > Marauders + Bunkers\n\n- Spire? > Switch Factory (2) (3) to Tech Labs > Thors\n\n## Execution\n\n- Use Hellions to pressure Zerg into more Spine Crawlers and switch to Medivac-drop once they finish walling off the natural.\n\n- When the Third mining base shows up, push out with Siege Tanks and take your third base, keeping in mind Hellions need to patrol for Zergling Back-Stabs.

{"document": "# Battle.net Leagues\n## Ladder Points\n### Bonus Pool\n\nThe Bonus Pool is the sum of all \"bonus points\" a player can get, which are added to the rating points a player earns after a victory or, in the case of a defeat, points are deducted from the bonus pool rather than the player's ladder points. The Bonus Pool serves two purposes: to encourage players to play games so their points are always trending upward, and as a global decay mechanism since all players have equal access to the same amount of Bonus Pool.\n\nPlayers receive Bonus Pool points at a set rate per league.  Before Season 3, all players received points at the Master league (original) rate.  Season 3 introduced a separate accrual rate for leagues below Master.  A player joining StarCraft freshly after the start of a season instantly receives the Bonus Pool as if he started at day 1 of the Season. (Example: Master League Player 1 joins on week 3 after the beginning of the Season he will receive a Bonus Pool of  (180*3) 540 Points instantly after finishing his Placement Match.)\n\n| League | Time per 1 Bonus Pool | Bonus Pool per Week |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Grandmaster | 56 minutes | 180 |\n| Master | 56 minutes | 180 |\n| Diamond | 96 minutes, 3 seconds | 104.4 |\n| Platinum | 96 minutes, 3 seconds | 104.4 |\n| Gold | 96 minutes, 3 seconds | 104.4 |\n| Silver | 96 minutes, 3 seconds | 104.4 |\n| Bronze | 96 minutes, 3 seconds | 104.4 |\n\nArranged 2v2 teams receive Bonus Pool at 66% the rate of 1v1.

This change was made in Patch 1.3 to make it easier to spend Bonus Pool on arranged teams, because of the logistics of having to play with the same teammates every time.  Random 2v2/3v3/4v4 uses the standard 1v1 Bonus Pool accrual rate because those game modes can be played whenever the individual player decides to queue.[13]\n\nBonus pool accrual rates have been tuned for team matchmaking modes to make them more competitive:[4]\n\n- 1v1: no change\n\n- Random Team: 50% reduction\n\n- Arranged Team: 75% reduction\n\n- Archon Mode: 75% reduction", "question": "In StarCraft II, how are Bonus Pool points affected for arranged 2v2 teams compared to 1v1 matches?", "options": ["They receive 100% the rate of 1v1.", "They receive 50% the rate of 1v1.", "They receive 66% the rate of 1v1.", "They receive 33% the rate of 1v1."], "answer": "They receive 66% the rate of 1v1."}

{"document": "# Liberator\n## Description\n\nThe Liberator is a fast and versatile Terran air unit introduced in Legacy of the Void. It can be built from the Starport and double produced from a Reactor.\n\n\"In order to combat clusters of aerial threats, the Dominion created the Liberator; a gunship-class vessel inspired by the old United Earth Directorate Valkyrie.\" This air-superiority craft has an area of effect on its air-to-air attack in \"Fighter Mode\". In this mode, it is slower than Medivacs & Warp Prisms with their Speed Upgrades, Phoenices, Oracles, and Mutalisks, and has the same speed as Corruptors; it is able to chase down any other target.

It can have its range upgraded, by researching Advanced Ballistics (requires a Fusion Core). It can also be produced with a Reactor, whereas the Tank requires a Factory with Tech Lab. Siege Tanks need defense from ground units via Bunkers and buildings to block the enemy from simply rushing up to the Tanks, while Liberators may be accompanied by either Widow Mines for combined anti-air and ground or a few Missile Turrets, Vikings or Marines, depending on whether the enemy is trying to overwhelm from the ground or is using air-to air units.", "question": "What is the primary role of the Liberator when it transforms into 'Defender Mode'?", "options": ["Becomes a mobile air-to-air unit", "Becomes a stationary air-to-ground unit", "Becomes a stationary air-to-air unit", "Becomes a mobile air-to-ground unit"], "answer": "Becomes a stationary air-to-ground unit"}

{"document": "# 4 Gate Push (vs. Zerg)\n\n4-Gate Push (vs. Zerg)\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:PvZ\nType:Mid-game\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is a build meant to rush your opponent in the early game, focusing on unit production from four warpgates.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe goal is to defeat the enemy early on with an overwhelming force.\n\n## Build Order\n\nThis follows the standard 1 Gate Core opening:\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 9 Pylon; 10 Chrono Boost Nexus; 13 Gateway; 14 Assimilator, (put 2 probes on gas), Chrono Boost Nexus; 15 Pylon; 17 Cybernetics Core; @100% Cybernetics Core - Chrono Boost, Warpgate Research; 18 Zealot; 22 Stalker, Stop Probe production; @450 Minerals: 3 Gateways; 24 Stalker; 26 proxy Pylon, move out, put 3rd probe on gas if necessary (if he's going roaches) |\n|  |\n\n- 9 Pylon\n\n- 10 Chrono Boost Nexus\n\n- 13 Gateway\n\n- 14 Assimilator, (put 2 probes on gas), Chrono Boost Nexus\n\n- 15 Pylon\n\n- 17 Cybernetics Core\n\n- @100% Cybernetics Core - Chrono Boost, Warpgate Research\n\n- 18 Zealot\n\n- 22 Stalker, Stop Probe production\n\n- @450 Minerals: 3 Gateways\n\n- 24 Stalker\n\n- 26 proxy Pylon, move out, put 3rd probe on gas if necessary (if he's going roaches)\n\n### Scouting\n\nThis build has a natural weakness to Roaches, it is vital to gauge the timing of any Roach Warren and any expansions. Roaches on the field will create problems for a 4 gate attack, and unless the Zerg takes a fast expansion, it is unlikely that an overwhelming numerical advantage can be had from 4 gates. Any aggression from Roaches can delay your attack so it is best to quickly transition into 3-gate/robo and prioritize an Immortal or two in order to mitigate this weakness and attack before Lair tech. Expansions by the Zerg player will limit his unit count and work in your favor, opening a timing window to attack before the Zerg realizes its economic advantage.  Always explore the possibility of a proxy Pylon in the Zerg base, but realize that it is more difficult to execute due to Zerg's scouting options.\n\n## Execution\n\nOnce Warpgate research finishes, it is time to push out and attempt an attack.  If a proxy Pylon was planted in your opponent's base you should move out any units towards it, leaving behind a Zealot and Sentry to prevent speedling counterattacks and begin warping in units inside their base.\n\nWithout a proxy, you should warp in around your base and push out toward them. A probe should advance with your army and set up a Pylon midway between bases or close to the enemy natural to reinforce your attack.\n\nPrioritize Stalkers if you scouted Roaches or a heavy investment in Spine Crawlers, otherwise prioritize Zealots to deal with high Zergling counts. A Sentry or two is always useful to deny mobility or reinforcements to the Zerg with force fields.\n\nAim to do significant economic damage, killing drones or Queens, or snipe an expansion.  Accept losses to destroy a Hatchery, a units worth in drones, or tech building but do not overcommit in the event that the Zerg has heavily defended their main base.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nIf the Zerg is not prioritizing his economic development by expanding or building drones (and is less susceptible to this attack in the first place) you can poke at your opponent's base while expanding to your own natural and teching up. If your opponent sustains damage or holds you off they will be moving on teching past Lair if they haven't already.  You will need to scout your opponents tech choices; an observer can be used if you have a Robotics Facility.  If not, hallucinated Phoenixes are an excellent alternative.  Be sure to keep your new base safe from sneaky counterattacks and prepare a response to your opponent's next moves.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\n- Small\n\n- Short walking distance\n\n### Con features\n\n- Any map that is fairly level and wide open.\n\n## VODs", "question": "In the 4-Gate Push strategy against Zerg, what is the primary unit you should prioritize if you scout Roaches or a heavy investment in Spine Crawlers?", "options": ["Zealots", "Immortals", "Stalkers", "Sentries"], "answer": "Stalkers"}
{"document": "# Gate Nexus YufFE (vs. Zerg)\n## Pro-Wall vs. Noob-Wall\n\nA wall is always advised against Zerg. Early Pools (6 Pool, 10 Pool, etc.) are hard to deal with in lower leagues. Therefore you should build a Noob-Wall if you are Gold or below. Try to use a Pro-Wall if you are Platinum or higher. On maps like Akilon Wastes or Entombed Valley a Pro-Wall is strongly suggested, because your main ramp is open a long time or even the whole game.\n\nIf Zerg would attack a Noob-Wall instead of the Natural, he would be able to enter the main base. A Pro-Wall would force the Zerg to build more Banelings. Why? A Pylon has \"200/200\" and is killed more easily than a Core with \"550/550\".\n\nThis screenshot (Alterzim) shows to Master players (ZvP). Protoss forgot to place his Zealot right, so Zerg makes a run-by with Speedlings. It's almost impossible to make that mistake with a Noob-Wall.

{"document": "# 4\n## Transitions to the Mid Game\n### Starting the Mid-Game\n\nYour opening will provide you with many crucial pieces of information, but in the case that you have not completely pinned the Zerg on his mid game style of choice, proceed with caution but determination. Focus on a 11:30 timing that is opened by you getting 1/1 and Stim. These upgrades line up with your production kicking in and is a crucial timing with the 4M playstyle. Be wary of any Zerg that has shown you Roaches before this timing, or that was harvesting an usual amount of gas in the earlier part of the game. Special attention needs to this style of Zerg. Use your Hellions, without losing them, to scout out his third base and to see a Drone count there. If there are no Drones, or very few Drones, at his third by 8:00, you should be very concerned about an aggressive play coming from the Zerg. If there is still few or no Drones at 9:00, it is certain that aggression is coming. If you feel that an aggressive play is coming, you will need to deviate from the goal of the 11:30 timing and focus on reacting to the Zerg's specific flavor of aggression. Do note that if the Zerg is committing to some kind of aggressive three base all-in this can be a game ending move. Pay attention to what your Hellions are able to see. In extreme cases, you can attempt to scan for a tech building or to to measure his economy. This is unreliable and should only be done when you are completely blind and do not want to make a blind decision.\n\nAssuming that you have not seen signs of an aggressive style coming from the Zerg, you will push out at the 11:30 timing mentioned above. The goal of the 1/1 Stim timing is to contest map control. Behind every action you do during this push, keep the true purpose of map control in mind. Do not sacrifice or trade units. Doing so will leave you without any map control, and therefore, is counter productive to your goal. Your main targets will be Creep Tumors, stray Overlords, and Queens that have overextended. This push will force the Zergs hand and he will have to show you his unit composition at this point. At this point you can modify your play and mindset to better match his playstyle.", "question": "What is the primary goal of the 11:30 timing push in the Terran vs Zerg mid-game strategy?", "options": ["To completely destroy the Zerg's economy", "To contest map control", "To scout the Zerg's third base", "To force the Zerg into an aggressive playstyle"], "answer": "To contest map control"}

If you scout this, you should stop making Mutalisks immediately and switch over to making a combination of Roaches and Infestors.\n\nThis strategy is particularly vulnerable to Hellions until your Spire completes, since you will only have Zerglings and Banelings, both of which are countered by Hellions, so you should always prepare for Hellions when doing this strategy.", "question": "Which unit is particularly vulnerable to Hellions during the Muta/Ling/Bane strategy in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Mutalisks", "Roaches", "Zerglings", "Infestors"], "answer": "Zerglings"}

Attaching a Reactor allows the Starport to produce two of these units at a time while attaching a Tech Lab allows a Starport to produce Banshees, Ravens and Battlecruisers (the latter also requiring a Fusion Core).\n\nA common technique is to start both your Starport and a Reactor on your Factory as soon as the Factory is complete.  Since both take 50 seconds to complete, you can swap the Factory and Starport upon completion (resulting in a Reactored Starport) allowing you to immediately \"double-pump\" Medivacs or Vikings.

{"document": "# Creep\n## Creep Generation\n### Creep Mechanics\n\nWhen a creep source finishes building, it immediately spawns a few tiles of creep, which spreads to fill an assigned footprint in the shape of a squared circle.

Creep must spread from adjacent creep, so it will not spread up or down a cliff (except passable ramps) or through a wall. It can however maintain creep not connected to it. For example, if a Creep Tumor is at the base of a cliff while an Overlord drops creep on the high ground, the Creep Tumor will sustain and grow that creep, even if the Overlord leaves.\n\nA Creep Tumor takes about 73 s to fill its entire area, but maps only rarely have such wide spaces, so Creep Tumors will usually fill up their area in less time. If a Creep Tumor is placed right at the edge of another's field, about 42% (138-148 tiles) of its area is already covered and it will take about 42 s to fill its remaining area.

Protoss\n\nIn ZvP Locusts can be used to force the Protoss to move units and expend Psi Storms.  Constant repositioning of the Swarm Hosts and only spawning some of the Locusts at a time can force the Protoss to reposition.  In combination with Ravagers, Locusts can help a Zerg batter down Protoss armies by pinning them in place with cheap units.  Care is needed becaues the Swarm Hosts are unwieldy and vulnerable when recharging.  In the final series of the 2018 WCS Global Finals (VOD), Serral used them in several games against Stats to great effect. The 2019 WCS match between Rogue and Neeb was notable for several highly effective Swarm Host contains[1].\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nLocusts are typically sent en masse into Terran positions. If the Terran does not commit significant forces to defence, large groups of Locusts can deal significant damage to a base or encamped army. A Terran player will typically employ Siege Tanks against a Locust threat. Tanks in Siege Mode have excellent range and splash damage, making them the most cost-effective unit to defend a position against Locusts.

{"document": "# Phoenix (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nWith the removal of the Mothership Core, as well as the sentry hallucination buff, Phoenix play is a lot more powerful now, as the Shield Battery doesn't have the same effect Photon overcharge did when warding away Phoenix.\n\nPhoenix, or Stargate builds in general, are a good soft-counter to Robotics tech, as well as Nexus first builds.\n\nWith the Hallucination buff, of lowering the energy cost to 75, Protoss now tend to tech Stargate units, to allow easier defense of Phoenix, usually evolving into full scale Phoenix wars. In these armies, Protoss spend the vast majority of their resources building pretty much only Phoenix, as whoever wins the Phoenix war, wins the game.\n\nHowever some players open Robotics Facility tech and Phoenix can counter them due to the fact that:\n\n- Phoenix can lift Immortals to neutralize their attack and kill them in relative safety.\n\n- Phoenix can attack Colossi directly.\n\n- Phoenix cannot be attacked by Zealots, Colossi nor Immortals.\n\n- A Phoenix has 180 effective hp and counts as light, thereby able to take 14 Stalker hits before dying, 15 with +1 Air Armor.\n\n- The Phoenix is one of the fastest units in StarCraft II, giving it the ability to enter and escape battles quickly.\n\n- Phoenix also cancel the Disruptor's Purification Nova, making them necessary when you face Stalker-Disruptor compositions with Immortal Archon Chargelot.\n\nThese advantages make the Phoenix a surprisingly viable option in the match-up. However, Phoenix have very little stopping power on their own. They cannot stop your opponent from expanding, and they offer little threat in punishing your opponent. Top level players prefer to spend the initial energy of phoenix to kill at least 1 probe per phoenix before save up energy for big battle. This economic harassment allows a player to close the income gap when opening Phoenix against a quicker expansion.\n\nAgainst an opponent who opens up with Robotics tech, Phoenixes will easily shut that play down.  Immortals are utterly useless against Phoenixes due to lack of anti-air capabilities, although you should be careful if they make Stalkers.  Should the opponent try for a 3Gate Robo Immortal All-in play, Phoenixes can also snipe Sentries à grâce the bonus damage to light units and resistance to Stalkers' anti-armor attacks. They can also snipe the Warp Prism rendering the push dead in the water, if the opponent isn't careful enough.\n\nA common use for the Phoenix is to get 5 or 6 and constantly harass the opponent's mineral line. 5 Phoenix generate an average of 50 energy (enough for one use of Graviton Beam) for every 17.7 seconds (roughly 14 seconds with 6). Taking into account that Probe build time is 17 seconds (without Chronoboost), means 6 Phoenix allows the effective shut down of one base's Probe production.\n\nPhoenix will usually force a large anti-air response from the opponent. Most of the time, this means Stalkers (with or without Blink). As a result, progamers such as TT1 or DdoRo often build Immortals when opening with Phoenix.\n\nPlease note that the Phoenix is outranged by the Void Ray's range of 6 until their range is upgraded from the Fleet Beacon, after which they outrange Void Rays by 1.", "question": "Which of the following units cannot attack a Phoenix directly in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Zealots", "Colossi", "Immortals", "All of the above"], "answer": "All of the above"}

Designed as a two-player “rush map”, it was played on the Blizzard ladder until it was removed in February, 2011 in favor of four-player “rush” maps.[1][2][3] Due to its lamentable balance, it disappeared from competitive use shortly thereafter.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nThere is a straight path to attack your enemy. Side paths offer additional resources. Rocks offer access to surprise attack routes.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Rocks protecting Thirds - Destructible rocks bar the direct way to the third bases. These are accessible through two ramps.\n\n- Rush Distance - There is an extremely short rush distance on this map, often encouraging early-game aggression.\n\n- Xel'Naga Towers - These can give vision of the high-yield expansions, but due to the brush blocking sight of them, the player occupying the expansion may not be aware that the tower has been activated.\n\n- Exposed Natural - There is a wide ramp outside the natural expansion that makes defending a fast-expansion build more difficult.

Because of Concussive Shells and Stim, Zealots will be unable to hit MMM very much since Marines and Marauders will Kite them forever.  Because Zealots are needed to kill off pushes, Sentries need to assist the Zealots by Force Fielding behind MMM forces in order for Zealots to deal significant damage.\n\nWhen defending bases, Force Field timings will depend on your unit composition.

{"document": "# General ZvP Strategy\n## Offense\n\n- Protoss development is typically a little slower than that of other races, making early Zergling harass effective. Protoss will typically defend against this by walling in with buildings and a stationary Zealot. You can punish a Protoss opponent who fails to do this correctly.\n\n- Target Sentries to prevent Force Fields from separating your army. Roaches with the Tunneling Claws upgrade can Burrow and tunnel under forcefields if your army is separated.\n\n- Due to the effectiveness of Stalkers against Mutalisks, Zerg players typically choose Hydralisks over Mutalisks once Lair tech is available.\n\n- Protoss units tend to be more cost effective, beefier, and benefit greatly from upgrades in this match-up.  The key to this match-up is that most Protoss units do not have good DPS, and they tend to lack mobility.  Abusing these two weaknesses is key to this match-up.\n\n- Do not be afraid to trade armies with a Protoss player, as Protoss armies tend to be far more expensive and take much longer to reproduce.\n\n- A Protoss player that fast expands will typically not become aggressive because they will not have enough units to defend their expansion, relying instead on forcefields and cannons for defense.  There are two choices: drone up hard and take a fast third base which gives you an economic lead that leads to a strong mid to late game, or attempt a Roach/ling bust against his natural expansion.", "question": "In a Zerg versus Protoss match-up, which Zerg unit is typically chosen over Mutalisks once Lair tech is available due to the effectiveness of Stalkers against Mutalisks?", "options": ["Zerglings", "Hydralisks", "Corruptors", "Infestors"], "answer": "Hydralisks"}

{"document": "# Defender's Advantage\n\nDefender's Advantage refers to the well-known idea that a player is defending an attack at his/her base is at an inherent advantage stemming from the fact that the attack is occurring at a minimal distance from the defender's production facilities and that the defender has additional time to produce units (due to map attack distances).\n\nOf course, the defender's advantage is somewhat mitigated if both armies are maxed (200/200 supply), but this does not change the fact that the distance needed for reinforcements to arrive is reduced. In addition, even when supplies are maxed, proximity to static defense, such as fighting near a planetary fortress or near a shield battery, can provide an additional form of defender's advantage.\n\nAs Day(9) says, there is always a defender's advantage, but indeed there is one exception.

{"document": "# Spending quotient\n\nSpending quotient (generally referred to as SQ) a method to quantitatively assess a player’s economic management in a game. Simply put, SQ is a measure of Macro skill, with higher numbers being better.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe term itself was created in a forum post on Team Liquid as part of a detailed analysis of Macro across all leagues in the Starcraft 2 ladder, and has quickly become a well-used tool for comparing economic management between players.[1] The SQ of a certain player in a game is calculated using the following formula:\n\nWhere i represents resource collection rate and u represents average unspent resources. These values can be found on the score screen after a game. The result is usually a two-digit value, where a higher SQ means better economic management. While you can plug in your average income and resource collection rate manually, players may also wish to use automated tools, such as GG Tracker, to automatically track their SQ for each game.\n\n### Derivation\n\nDuring his research of score screen data from 2084 games between 2011-08-28 and 2011-09-15, TL.net user whatthefat noticed that \"Surprisingly, there is a very close to exponential relationship between Average Unspent Resources and Average Income\". He also noticed that players from all leagues spend their income in an approximately logarithmic fashion.\n\nBy assuming an exponential relationship with A and t as constants we get\n\nWhich is really close to the definition of SQ. The rest of the constants are put there to force SQ to vary between prettier numbers which makes numerical calculations more accurate and a lot easier for humans to comprehend. According to whatthefat \"the value 0.00137 was picked as a compromise value to yield a good fit across all leagues\".\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are a few limitations on the use of SQ as a measure of economic management:\n\n- Firstly, it is not reliable to use in very short games. Most players will not have much problem dealing with their income in this case, which results in all players having very high and similar SQ. In order to avoid this, the inventor of the term is recommending not to calculate SQ for games where the average income is lower than 600 resources per minute.\n\n- Secondly, the average SQ is somewhat dependent on which race is played. For example, Protoss players accumulate a lot of unspent resources before every Warpgate cycle, resulting in lower SQ compared to a Terran player of equal skill.\n\n- Thirdly, SQ may unfairly punish players who purposefully bank resources in the late game when they reach max supply.\n\n## Examples\n\nIf you play TheStaircase (Guide: english, german) it is important to keep improving your SQ. A high SQ is better than a low SQ. Players in Grandmaster often times have 90 or more.\n\n| Map/Replay | Matchup | Participants | RCR | AUR | SQ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dusk Towers | TvT | Nathanias vs PuLSe | 1.631 | 564 | 96 |\n| Ruins of Seras | ZvP | Dendroaspis vs Barry | 1.969 | 649 | 108 |\n| Prion Terraces | PvT | NeoBlade vs GrandAdmiral | 1.417 | 447 | 92 |\n| Ruins of Seras | TvT | hard vs naras | 1.839 | 8.913 | 10 |\n| Ulrena | TvZ | Neckbeard vs Gui | 921 | 2457 | 11 |\n\nAcronyms\n\n- RCR = Resource Collection Rate or Income. Dendroaspis leads with 1.969. He was a top 30 GM, when he played this game.\n\n- AUR = Average Unspent Resources. Hard has a good RCR with 1.839, but 8.913 AUR is way too much money in the bank.\n\nGathering Resources and spending your money is one of the most important skills in SC2. You should try to improve your Macro and your Mechanics. A high SQ will be the result if you do so.\n\n## Tools and sites\n\nThere are some tools and websites, which support calculation SQ.", "question": "Which of the following is a limitation of using Spending Quotient (SQ) as a measure of economic management in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It is unreliable for games where the average income is lower than 600 resources per minute.", "It is not applicable for players who use automated tools to track their SQ.", "It only applies to players who play the Protoss race.", "It increases the difficulty of numerical calculations for players."], "answer": "It is unreliable for games where the average income is lower than 600 resources per minute."}

It is built from a Factory with an attached Tech Lab.\n\nThe Siege Tank is a powerful tool for securing specific tactically important areas of the map, but somewhat immobile compared to other Terran units such as the Marine and other biological units, particularly due to its transformation time. They are also a reliable source of ground splash damage for Terrans.\n\nIn siege mode, Siege Tanks do 40 (+30 against armored) splash damage. This damage decreases in a radius around the epicenter: units (whether hostile or friendly) within .4687 matrices of the target take full damage, units between .4687 and .7812 matrices of the target take 50% damage, and units between .7812 and 1.25 matrices from the target take 25% damage.\n\n|  |  | vs. Light | vs. Armored |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mode | Cooldown | Damage | DPS | Damage | DPS |\n| Tank | 0.74 | 15 (+2) | 20.3 (+2.7) | 25 (+3) | 33.8 (+4.1) |\n| Siege | 2.14 | 40 (+4) | 18.7 (+1.87) | 70 (+5) | 32.7 (+2.34) |", "question": "What is the primary advantage of the Siege Tank's Siege Mode in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Increased mobility", "Higher damage output against biological units", "Splash damage from a longer range", "Ability to fly over obstacles"], "answer": "Splash damage from a longer range"}

They usually offer plenty of space to place your supply, production and tech buildings.\n\n## Ramp\n\nRamps, i.e. passages from low to higher ground, can be anywhere on the map. However, the expression your Ramp will usually refer to the ramp that is the entrance of your Main Base. Most current 1v1 Maps have a ramp leading up your Main Base.\n\n## Natural\n\nMost maps have an expansion base just outside your Main Base. This base is referred to as the Natural, which was shortened from natural expansion, as the closest location is also the most natural to expand at.\n\nSometimes your Main Base will have a Ramp in front and another Ramp leading to a Natural at the back of the base that is inaccessible for the enemy, but frequently guarded by destructible rocks. This is called a Backdoor Natural. Having one of these might lead to you having two Naturals, a Front Natural and a Backdoor Natural. An example of this setup is Crevasse.\n\n## Choke\n\nThe Choke is a narrowed entrance to a base. Most of the time, your Natural will have a Choke that makes it easier to defend. Nerazim Crypt, for example, has a Choke at the Natural which is made very narrow by the presence of Destructible Rocks. Sometimes the entrance to your Main Base will also be referred to as your Choke; however, since most Main Base entrances are ramps, the expression is mostly used for the Natural.\n\n## High and Low Ground\n\nStarcraft knows several height levels. Units cannot hit other units that are on a higher level without having gained vision of that level.\n\n## Cliff\n\nA Cliff is the High Ground territory that looms over a certain Low Ground. Your Cliff will most often refer to the Cliff above your Natural that needs to protected, as your opponent might try to exploit it with long range units like Siege Tanks. Air Units ignore Cliffs. Colossi and Reapers are able to scale cliffs without aid.", "question": "In StarCraft II, which feature is characterized by a narrowed entrance to a base, often found at the Natural expansion, and is used to make defense easier?", "options": ["Ramp", "Choke", "Cliff", "Natural"], "answer": "Choke"}

{"document": "# Mech (vs. Terran)\n## Upgrades\n\nBefore reaching three bases, there's generally not that many upgrades involved in mech play - Infernal Pre-Igniter is the only required one. Attack upgrades for mech are not very useful against a Marine/Marauder-heavy opponent as it takes a lot of upgrades before they actually make a difference in how many tank shots it takes to kill them. Armor upgrades may let your mech army survive longer, but against a bio-heavy style your goal should be to avoid taking those shots in the first place.\n\nIf both players are going mech, upgrades are a bit more favourable. A big reason for this is that an Armory is required for Thors which soak up a lot of tank damage. Some important Armory upgrades are:\n\n- If your opponent has no mech armor upgrades, +1 attack on your Siege Tanks will allow them to kill your opponent's Siege Tanks in 3 shots instead of 4 (while sieged)\n\n- No matter the armor upgrades, +1 attack on your Siege Tanks will allow them to kill your opponent's Thors in 7 shots instead of 8 (while sieged)\n\n- Until your opponent gets +2 armor, +2 attack on your Siege Tanks will allow them to kill your opponent's Thors in 6 shots\n\n- +1 air armor on your Vikings will allow them to survive one extra volley from other Vikings until your opponent gets +1 air attack\n\nLater in the game, if you transition into mass air, air armor upgrades get very important, especially if you have the superior Viking count. The only ground-to-air capabilities Terran has (Marines, Thors and Missile Turrets) don't do a lot of damage but do it very quickly, which means that armor upgrades are very effective.", "question": "Which upgrade allows your Siege Tanks to kill your opponent's Thors in 6 shots instead of 8, assuming your opponent has not yet upgraded to +2 armor?", "options": ["+1 attack on your Siege Tanks", "+2 attack on your Siege Tanks", "+1 armor on your Siege Tanks", "+2 armor on your Siege Tanks"], "answer": "+2 attack on your Siege Tanks"}

It also hosted the fourth Blizzard Battlereport between David Kim (T) and Yean-Ho Lee (P).  The map was removed from official Ladder play on February 25, 2011, as well as most popular competitions, it was replaced by The Shattered Temple.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nYour base is easy to defend with easily defended additional resources. Watch Towers overlook the central battlefield. Islands contain additional resources.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Cliffs overlooking the natural expansions provide an effective drop point. In TvZ, an early Thor drop on the high ground can be particularly hard to counter.\n\n- Two island expansions, at 10 and 4 o'clock.\n\n- Destructible rocks block high-yield expansion CC/Nexus/Hatchery placement, so time and resources must be allocated to freeing that up prior to expanding.\n\n- The high yield expansions can be sieged from the highground next to the natural expansions.\n\n- The two Xel'Naga Towers between them reveal all of the main choke points on the map, making them an invaluable point of control.\n\n## Protoss Wall-ins\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Lost Temple34867382956.7%68353351.5%110476342.7%345712\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Lost Temple | 348 | 67 | 38 | 29 | 56.7% | 68 | 35 | 33 | 51.5% | 110 | 47 | 63 | 42.7% | 34 | 57 | 12 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2011-01-122011-03-20\nGosu\nCoaching Premiere League Season 12011-02-072011-02-102011 Global StarCraft II Team League Feb2011-01-022011-01-292011 Sony Ericsson Global StarCraft II League January2010-11-152010-12-182010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 32010-11-252010-11-27\nDream\nHack Steel\nSeries LAN2010-10-092010-11-132010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 22010-11-052010-11-072010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas2010-10-152010-10-162010 MLG Pro Circuit Washington D.C.2010-08-282010-10-022010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 12010-08-272010-08-282010 MLG Pro Circuit Raleigh2010-08-182010-08-22\nIEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2011-01-12 | 2011-03-20 |  | GosuCoaching Premiere League Season 1 |\n| 2011-02-07 | 2011-02-10 |  | 2011 Global StarCraft II Team League Feb |\n| 2011-01-02 | 2011-01-29 |  | 2011 Sony Ericsson Global StarCraft II League January |\n| 2010-11-15 | 2010-12-18 |  | 2010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 3 |\n| 2010-11-25 | 2010-11-27 |  | DreamHack SteelSeries LAN |\n| 2010-10-09 | 2010-11-13 |  | 2010 Sony Ericsson StarCraft II Open Season 2 |\n| 2010-11-05 | 2010-11-07 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Dallas |\n| 2010-10-15 | 2010-10-16 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Washington D.C. |\n| 2010-08-28 | 2010-10-02 |  | 2010 TG Sambo Intel StarCraft II Open Season 1 |\n| 2010-08-27 | 2010-08-28 |  | 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Raleigh |\n| 2010-08-18 | 2010-08-22 |  | IEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne |", "question": "On the Lost Temple map, what is a particularly effective strategy for Terran versus Zerg (TvZ) that involves an early drop?", "options": ["An early Banshee drop on the natural expansion", "An early Thor drop on the high ground", "An early Reaper drop on the main base", "An early Hellion drop on the mineral line"], "answer": "An early Thor drop on the high ground"}

{"document": "# Brood Lord (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nBrood Lords are rarely used in ZvZ. Many matches will not last long enough for players to even tech to them, as many matches in this matchup do not see late game. When ZvZ late game does happen, the most viable composition is Hydralisk/Lurker/Viper as opposed to featuring Brood Lords for a number of reasons. Many inexperienced players may be tempted into using Brood Lords for their potency in other matchups, but because Zerg units are so mobile and can easily make potent counter attacks with speed-upgraded Zerglings or burrow-move Roaches, the immobile Brood Lords will offer very limited defense aside from their single position; attacking forces can easily retreat before the Brood Lords reach them. Lurkers, on the other hand may be comfortably left behind one or two per base for a strong counter attack defense that takes up less supply, costs less, offers splash damage, is protected from attack without detection, and once range-upgraded, has the same range as a Brood Lord. In more reactive situations, Lurkers also benefit from speed bonuses on Creep and can have their speed upgraded as well. Finally, against Brood Lords themselves, Lurkers shred Broodlings near instantly, providing support for Hydra-focused ground armies to assault the Brood Lords themselves. Brood Lords trying to siege a Hydra/Lurker/Viper army can be easily Abducted into Hydralisk range and quickly dispatched while they slowly try to retreat.\n\nBecause Brood Lords are morphed from Corruptors and because they are vulnerable to air-to-air attacks, Brood Lords will often be fielded with a handful of Corruptors in tow. This commitment to air units severely impacts the player making Brood Lords' ability to contest ground armies running over them or outflanking them.

{"document": "# Medivac (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n### AI Particulars\n\nMedivac AI handles attack commands differently from a standard combat unit. When given an order to patrol, force-fire, or attack-move (by itself or in a group with other units), it will stop to heal any damaged infantry in its proximity. It will also stay close to any infantry actively attacking an enemy unit/building, regardless of whether those infantry need healing or not. Its Heal autocast skill is treated as its 'attack', and its preferred targets are infantry that are damaged or in combat. When all infantry are dead, or stop attacking the enemy, the Medivac will remember its last ordered position and move there. Give it a move command, or take Heal off of autocast, and the Medivac will go directly to any location ordered.\n\nOn the other side, StarCraft II combat AI has assigned Medivacs the same priority for attack as any other \"standard\" unit, resulting in distance being the only factor for target selection. This may sometimes be beneficial as it diverts fire from your army, and sometimes detrimental, as in the case of drops, as hostile units may not switch to unloaded units until their first choice is either dead or out of range; your units may be left stranded if the Medivac is not micromanaged effectively. This does not apply when the dropped units are attacking back; if a Marine is engaging a Medivac and a hostile Marauder drops and starts attacking, the Marine will defend itself from the attacker, giving the Marauder higher priority, and saving the Medivac.", "question": "When a Medivac is ordered to patrol, force-fire, or attack-move, what does it prioritize doing?", "options": ["Attacking enemy structures", "Healing damaged infantry in proximity", "Ignoring damaged units and moving to the target location", "Focusing on air units exclusively"], "answer": "Healing damaged infantry in proximity"}

{"document": "# Battlecruiser (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Battlecruiser is the Terran's capital ship. In LotV, the Battlecruiser has been granted the Tactical Jump ability, allowing it to teleport anywhere on the map (regardless of fog of war).\n\nIt can be constructed at a Starport with a Tech Lab add-on once a Fusion Core has been built. Similar to its Brood War counterpart, the Battlecruiser is a slow but powerful unit. It can deal large amounts of damage and has high health. This flying fortress boasts the highest default armour value of any combat unit in the game, which can make it particularly hard to kill. However, like in Brood War, the Battlecruiser is rarely used due to its slow speed, high cost and lengthy tech tree. Despite this, if built when the Terran has a large advantage, it can seal the victory and make a comeback very difficult. Players also sometimes pull SCVs to repair Battlecruisers during combat. The Battlecruiser retains the Yamato Cannon from Brood War.\n\nWhile held back by its excessive cost and time to build up to, the Battlecruiser is one of the few units that can harass bases even under heavy fire due to its high default health and armor, and its ability to fire while moving. With proper micro, the Battlecruiser is very likely to survive long enough to use Tactical Jump to retreat back to the player's side of the map to be repaired and repeat the process. Battlecruisers that survive past the early to mid game can also obtain the Yamato Cannon upgrade later on to snipe bases and T3 units. This makes the Battlecruiser very cost effective if it survives and is a global pressure tool (not unlike the Ghost's Tactical Nuke). However, a player who has opted to rush Battlecruisers will most likely have minimal defense back at home and is vulnerable to counter attacks as well as be behind in upgrades due to the aforementioned cost of going such a build.", "question": "Which of the following abilities allows the Battlecruiser to teleport anywhere on the map in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Yamato Cannon", "Tactical Jump", "Siege Mode", "Cloaking Field"], "answer": "Tactical Jump"}

{"document": "# Mutalisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n#### Upgrades\n\nIn Mutalisk vs Mutalisk battles, Flyer Carapace should always be upgraded rather than Flyer Attacks if possible; Air Carapace decreases the damage of all 3 bounces from the glaive wurm by 1 each, while Air Attack only increases the damage of the attacks by 1, 0.33, and 0.11. Air Attack is preferred against Corruptors as it increases the damage dealt to Corruptors by ~16% while Air Carapace only decreases the damage taken by ~7%. Against Hydralisks, the correct upgrade depends on what Mutalisks are being used to accomplish. Attack upgrades assist in sniping Hydralisks, Queens, and Spore Crawlers, but armor helps soak up damage, allowing more time for ground units to close with the Hydralisks.\n\nBecause the effectiveness of upgrades increases as the number of units increases, a player who upgrades their Mutalisks early should play defensively and accumulate Mutalisks rather than trading them against enemy units, and then make a timing attack as soon as the upgrade completes.

It should be noted that this is not an alternative to getting Hydralisks for air defense but rather a temporary solution to early harass.\n\nProducing an extra Queen or two can help save resources; multiple Mutalisks can be restored to full health with Transfusions after an harassment. Due to the high value of Brood Lords, bringing Queens to the front line has become more popular - provided creep has been spread appropriately throughout the game. The Queen's lack of common attributes (i.e. Light or Armored) combined with a relatively large amount of HP and extended by Transfusion(s) make for a surprisingly good tank; being nothing but biological and psionic, it only receives bonus damage from Archons and the Ghost's Snipe.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what ability of the Queen can be used to heal multiple Mutalisks after a harassment?", "options": ["Spawn Larva", "Transfusion", "Creep Tumor", "Burrow"], "answer": "Transfusion"}

Permanent Cloak is primarily countered by detector units, the Observer, Raven and Overseer, and the static defense towers, the Photon Cannon, Spore Crawler and Missile Turret.\n\nPermanent Cloaking makes the Dark Templar a very powerful reconnaissance and harassment unit, because the enemy must ensure that he has detection near both his bases and armies.  If the opponent does not have Detection, the already powerful Dark Templar is a deadly assassin.\n\nThe Observer also possesses Permanent Cloak.  This, along with the Observer's Detection capabilities make the Observer a great information-gatherer.  Observers are built in almost every game because of the wealth of information they can potentially provide.  The ability icon for the Observer shows an Observer in blue lines, as the Dark Templar's icon shows a blue Dark Templar.\n\n## Use\n\nIn competitive play the Permanent Cloak of Dark Templars forces the opponent to get detection. When facing Dark Templar opponents are often forced to turtle in their base until detection becomes available. If attacking alongside a Protoss army, Dark Templar can often remain undetected to an opponent throughout a major battle.

{"document": "# 3 Gate Aggressive Expansion (vs. Terran)\n## Basic Build Order\n### Notes\n\n- When your attack hits you should have 4-5 Zealots, 5 Sentries, and a Stalker (this unit composition can vary by personal preference). This, with follow-up reinforcements, is oftentimes enough to bust the Terran's natural expansion or deal significant damage when SCVs are pulled from the mineral line to repair Bunkers. Once your Zealots die it's usually a good idea to back off down the ramp and warp-in more units, this is as a large SCV pull will likely be able to kill off your Sentries and Stalkers.\n\n- The reason you warp-in three Zealots followed by Sentries is two-fold. First off, you will have an accumulation of minerals (about 600-700) that need to be sunk pretty quickly. Three Zealots followed by a Nexus do this wonderfully. The second reason is that it gives you enough time to accumulate the gas needed to warp-in three Sentries all at once. This opening is a highly optimized way to get a lot of units out very quickly and very cleanly, which should allow you to be aggressive at a timing when you have more than your opponent.\n\n- With this opening you will live or die by your force field usage, so you best be able to utilize them properly. Also, make sure you use Guardian Shield when you engage as it effectively gives your Zealots +2 Armour.\n\n- Before you lay down your Nexus, be sure to clear away any SCV from your natural expansion location. You should be doing this with a Zealot, Stalker and Sentry.\n\n- Place the Proxy Pylon before your forces arrive, and be sure to warp-in your Zealots at your natural expansion.

{"document": "# Ghost (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Ghost is a specialized infantry unit built from a Barracks with an attached Tech Lab once a Ghost Academy has been constructed. The Ghost stands as an Anti-Spellcaster unit and high damage versus Light units.\n\nSteady Targeting deals 130 (+40 vs Psionic) damage regardless of armor to any biological unit at the cost of 50 energy. It cannot be queued to multiple units, so it is mostly effective against high health biological units or for quickly dispatching high impact units. Steady Targeting returns its energy cost if it fails.\n\n- Steady Targeting one shots Dark Templar, High Templar, Hydralisks, Zerglings, Infestors, Mutalisks, Marauders, Marines, Ghosts, Reapers, Vipers, Banelings, Ravagers, Drones and SCVs.\n\n- The following units require two spells to kill: Adepts, Hellbats, Zealots, Roaches, Swarm Hosts, Lurkers, Corruptors, Brood Lords, Queens, Overseers and Overlords.\n\n- An Ultralisk requires four spells to be killed.\n\nThe Ghost's Cloak allows it to render itself invisible to enemies without detection. This is generally used to get the Ghost into a good position to EMP or Steady Target an opponent, or to sneak into a base for a Nuke. If using the Cloak to setup an EMP, you must keep an eye on the energy bar as it could prove disastrous if you do not have enough Energy left to cast EMP against various armies.\n\nThe EMP Round is the Ghost's most important spell against Protoss due to every unit having shields. Against Zerg and Terran, EMP is effective against dedicated spellcasters. The AoE shot will remove 100 energy (and shields, if applicable) from all units/buildings under its effect. This is essential for use against Protoss opponents for many reasons. The spell effectively does up to 100 damage to anything it hits and can nullify many dangerous Protoss units. Used against a High Templar, the Ghost can prevent the use of Psionic Storm. It also reveals any cloaked units within its radius for a short time, rendering them vulnerable until the effect wears off (though it will not reveal burrowed units). The EMP Round can also be used against structures, where it can damage the shields of Protoss buildings or drain energy from an Orbital Command.\n\nThe Tactical Nuke is another ability of the Ghost and will allow the unit to call down a Nuke on a target location provided the Ghost Academy has a Nuke ready and that the Ghost can channel for the full-time. The Nuke is a devastating ability that deals terrible, terrible damage to any buildings or units that it hits. However, the cost of using Nukes is very high and requires a heavy amount of gas and minerals to tech to. The long call-down time (14 seconds) also renders it ineffective against units, as they can easily move away. However the large radius of a nuke and possibility to land multiple strikes can allow the Terran to create a more effective push by zoning out areas. The Nuke can also be used as a psychological weapon against your opponent due to its high damage potential and global alert. The Nuke deals 300 full damage to all units in the inner circle of the blast radius,  50% damage to the radius immediately after and 25% damage to the outermost bounds. Note also that the Nuke deals an additional 200 damage to structures, making it highly effective against fortified areas (effectively one shooting all forms of static defense but the planetary fortress. The Nuke is castable from a maximum of 12 range (though the ghost's vision range is only 11). A nuke is not cancelable in the last 0.5-0.7 seconds before impact. During this period the ghost calling the nuke can freely move already.", "question": "Which ability of the Ghost is most effective for nullifying dangerous Protoss units and revealing cloaked units?", "options": ["Steady Targeting", "Cloak", "EMP Round", "Tactical Nuke"], "answer": "EMP Round"}

{"document": "# Mining Minerals\n## Optimizing Mineral Harvesting\n### Transferring Workers\n\nBecause the marginal income rate of third worker of a patch is less efficient than the first two, transferring all of the third workers to a newly completed expo is ideal. However, when there are two or one workers per patch, transferring has no short-term improvement in mining efficiency, since those workers would mine at exactly the same rate as they would have if they stayed. There is actually a loss of money due to the non-mining time (generally about 10 minerals per worker). But transferring without having any third worker is only done so with the long-term goal of saturating all bases in the shortest amount of time in mind, not just one.\n\nIn a real game situation you often don't have the spare time to devote your attention to micromanaging your workers with specific consideration to close mineral patches.  Therefore, as a general rule, you should transfer all but two workers per each mineral patch to a new expansion.  Also, because every expansion has at least some close mineral patches (usually 2 to 4), you should aim to saturate these patches first with your transferred workers.  If your goal is to maximize long-term income, you should transfer, at minimum, workers equal to the number of close mineral patches there are at your new expansion and rally them individually en route.\n\nHere is the worker transfer equation, which determines the time it takes for a worker to break even by transferring:\n\nI(i) = Income (initial)\n\nI(f) = Income (final)\n\nt = time to break even\n\nd = distance travel time (range is generally ~15-18 seconds)\n\nThe following is a table of the time to break even for transferring workers with an assumed 15 second travel time:\n\n| Income (per minute) | Break Even Time |\n| --- | --- |\n| from 12 to 45 | 20.45 seconds |\n| from 24 to 45 | 32.14 seconds |\n| from 39 to 45 | 112.50 seconds |\n| from 45 to 45 | permanent loss of 11.25 minerals |\n| from 12 to 39 | 21.67 seconds |\n| from 24 to 39 | 39.00 seconds |\n| from 39 to 39 | permanent loss of 9.75 minerals |\n| from 45 to 39 | permanent loss of 11.25 minerals, then 6/min |\n\nReference: https://tl.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=266828&currentpage=3#42", "question": "When transferring workers to a new expansion, what is the optimal number of workers to leave per mineral patch to maximize mining efficiency in the short term?", "options": ["0", "1", "2", "3"], "answer": "2"}

{"document": "# StarCraft\n## Game Mechanics\n\nPlayers are required to strategically and quickly manage their Economy, Technology and Army in order to defeat their opponent. The basis of playing is, on the one hand, to harvest resources and on the other hand using said resources to purchase buildings, upgrades and units.\n\nIn this most basic understanding of the game we distinguish two tasks for the player: Macro and Micro. As the name indicates, Micro refers to more local, specialized events, while Macro concerns the overall flow of the game and the economical side. It is important for every Starcraft player to have a balance of these two.\n\nMicro (or micromanagement in full) encompasses managing your army. Moving, attacking, retreating with the ultimate goal of overpowering your opponent. Micro is the ability to control your units individually, in order to make up for pathing or otherwise imperfect AI. For example, splitting Marines in order to suffer fewer loss from a Baneling attack, or being able to perform multiple kills with Mutalisks is considered \"Micro\". The general theory of micro is to keep as many units alive as possible. For example it is better to have four half-dead Stalkers after a battle, rather than to have two Stalkers at full health and two dead ones.\n\nMacro encompasses managing your economy and technology: making sure you have an income (by harvesting resources) and spending said income (by purchasing buildings, upgrades and units). Macro is your ability to produce units, and keep all of your production buildings busy. Generally, the player with the better macro will have the larger army. The other element of macro is your ability to expand at the appropriate times to keep your production of units flowing. A good macro player is able to keep increasing his or her production capability while having the resources to support it.\n\nAll these operations take place in real-time - commands are executed as they are given. This means a player not only benefits from strategical insight, but also from speed and multitask ability, measured by APM (actions per minute). The ability to perform specific actions in limited time is often referred to as Mechanics.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what does the term 'Macro' primarily refer to?", "options": ["Managing your army and combat tactics", "Controlling your units individually during battles", "Managing your economy and technology", "Performing actions quickly with high APM"], "answer": "Managing your economy and technology"}

{"document": "# Mouse settings\n## CPI vs On-Screen Sensitivity\n\nCPI (counts per inch, often erroneously referred to as DPI -- dots per inch) is the scale at which a mouse converts physical distance to digital counts.\n\nThe CPI of a mouse correspond to how many movement counts are sent from the mouse when it is moved one inch. Without modification on the counts by the system, moving a 800 CPI mouse one inch horizontally should theoretically shift the cursor by 800 pixels in the same direction. Effectively, higher CPI will result in a more sensitive cursor. CPI is merely a conversion scale used by the sensor internally, and is not related to its frame-rate in any way.\n\nHigher CPI offers a faster cursor without sacrificing any precision. Turning up the sensitivity in Windows increases the speed but reduces the precision of the cursor. Increasing the sensitivity this way causes Windows or the game to take the number of pixels the cursor should have moved and multiply it. Thus, there are certain pixels where the mouse cursor cannot land. For example, if you multiply the mouse input by two, you'll never get an odd number. Only changing the CPI can change the cursor speed without losing precision; this is why many mice include on-the-fly CPI switching. Some mice be set up with custom profiles between which the user can switch. Most gamers prefer low CPI for first-person shooter games and high CPI for RTS and MOBA games.\n\nBecause CPI is based on pixels, monitor resolution plays a role in the perceived sensitivity of a mouse. A 1000CPI mouse will move the cursor 1000 pixels across the screen when the mouse is moved one inch. On a monitor running 1024x768 resolution, moving the mouse one inch horizontally will roughly move the mouse from one side of the screen to the other. On a 1920x1080 monitor, the cursor would move only about halfway across when the mouse is moved one inch. The higher the resolution of the monitor, the slower the mouse cursor will appear to move.", "question": "Why do most gamers prefer high CPI settings for Real-Time Strategy (RTS) and Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games?", "options": ["Because higher CPI reduces the precision of the cursor.", "Because higher CPI increases the speed of the cursor without sacrificing precision.", "Because higher CPI decreases the speed of the cursor, making it easier to control.", "Because higher CPI settings are required to play these types of games."], "answer": "Because higher CPI increases the speed of the cursor without sacrificing precision."}

It is somewhat analogous to the Terran 2 Rax Reactor/Tech-Lab opening.\n\nBy building two early Gateways and Chrono Boosting out Warpgate Research, the Protoss player has a small, early-game window during which they are able to out-produce their Terran opponent.

It requires 2 of any Templar, preferably High Templar that are low on energy, or Dark Templar when your opponent has detection, but either will do. The two selected Templar combine into an Archon. The process of transforming takes 8.57 seconds. The transforming Archon can be targeted and destroyed while in this process. Any damage sustained while the Archon is merging will remain once it has finished merging.\n\n## Use\n\nAny 2 High Templar, Dark Templar, or both, can combine to create a powerful psionic entity called the Archon. Archons excel at supporting forces with their psionic shockwaves and splash damage. They can only be produced by combining the expensive Templar, so they are usually created when High Templar run out of energy. Dark Templar can also be used, but they are best suited for other purposes. Another interesting aspect of the Archon is that its total hitpoints are mostly shield points, meaning that if it is near death, it can be drawn away for its shields to regenerate quickly, due to the new shield mechanic implemented in StarCraft II. However, This also makes them vulnerable to the Ghost's EMP, which takes away 100 shield points when it hits. They are most effective against Zerg, as their bonus (vs. biological) and splash damage make them extremely effective against almost all kinds of zerg forces.\n\n## Other\n\nWhen completed, Archons become battle ready.

Along with your earlier Mothership Core/Probe scouting, this should give you a clear image of what your opponent is doing. This scout timing will let you know if you should build an Immortal or an Observer first as well as whether or not you can skip the third Gateway in favor of a faster Forge.\n\nThis build stops Probe production at 38 supply to build a Nexus, Robotics Facility, and third Gateway. This timing also coincides with the 6:00 Hallucination scout and leaves you with 19 Probes on minerals, three on each gas, and one hiding on the map.

If you do not scout pressure, you should resume worker production and expand.\n\nUsing this build, your Hallucination scout will arrive at your opponent's base a little bit before your Robotics Facility finishes, allowing you the choice of making an Immortal or an Observer first based on what you see.

Rather ride out your advantage for a solid win.\n\nWith your Hydra heavy army, be careful about engaging Colossus or Sentry-heavy armies.\nBe aggressive versus a Protoss going for fast Storm.

{"document": "# Orbital Command Opening\n\nOrbital Command Opening\nTwo Reactors\nStrategy Information\nCreator(s):Fallen\nMatchups:TvT, TvP, TvZType:Opening\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Orbital Command opening is a standard opening for any match-up. Timing everything as minerals allow, this opening reveals very little information to scouting workers, as any choice of tech transition is still available.\n\nThis basic opening is used in virtually every standard build and goal that a Terran can pursue.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe overall goal of the Orbital Command Opening is to effectively open the game with a fast Orbital Command to provide MULEs while simultaneously taking a gas geyser and making a Barracks. This allows the player the economy and infrastructure to transition into absolutely any style of play available to the Terran race.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Orbital Command Opening |\n| --- |\n| 10/11 - Supply Depot (1); 12/19 - Barracks (1); 13/19 - Refinery (1); 15/19 - Marine (1); 15/19 - Orbital Command Upgrade; 16/19 - Supply Depot (2) |\n\n- 10/11 - Supply Depot (1)\n\n- 12/19 - Barracks (1)\n\n- 13/19 - Refinery (1)\n\n- 15/19 - Marine (1)\n\n- 15/19 - Orbital Command Upgrade\n\n- 16/19 - Supply Depot (2)\n\n### Notes\n\nOnce your Barracks has finished construction, there are multiple transition paths available to you. Adding a Factory, more Barracks, or Fast Expanding are all common.\n\n- You should constantly deploy MULEs to optimize your economy.\n\n## Scouting\n\nIt is common that the Terran player sends out their initial scouting SCV after their first Supply Depot has finished. You should send your first scout out at least before your Barracks finishes construction.\n\n## Execution\n\nExecution of the Orbital Command Opening is very simplistic, but there is one point that you should keep in mind:\n\nDue to changes in patch 1.4.0, in which the Barracks construction time was increased from 60 to 65 game seconds, this opener will experience a slight moment of \"clumsiness\" in which the player will have to remember to forego building an SCV for several seconds in order to start the Orbital Command upgrade on time.\n\n## Adaptation\n\nNearly every standard build in the Terran arsenal is constructed around the Orbital Command Opening. You will be able to transition neatly into any style you wish. It is impractical to list every possible Adaptation available to the Terran player to list each one. Look for more builds in the Terran Strategy section for builds.\n\n- General pointers are taking both Refineries for Factory or Starport units; only one for Barracks tech.\n\n- Add two more Barracks and a few Bunkers if lacking army size and worried about the size of the enemy army.\n\n## Variations\n\n- 12 Gas 13 Rax - 16 OC/Fac Opening\n\nThis variation of the OC Opening requires that you take your first gas before you begin construction on your Barracks. This makes it economically possible to begin building a Factory the instant that your Barracks finishes completion. This is particularly common in the TvT Match-up when a player is aiming to play a Mech Style midgame.\n\n- 15 Ref, 19 CC, 22 Factory - Delayed Gas Factory FE Opening\n\nThis variation allows the construction of a very fast Command Center before beginning construction of your first Factory. ST.Bomber uses this opening for a delayed Reactor Hellion Opening that allows for a fast Triple Orbital Command\n\n- 13 Rax - Gasless Expand Opening\n\nThis variation is purely for timing the second Supply Depot after Command Center (2) and transitions better into gasless builds like Triple OC opening and 4-5 Barracks-Marine pressure.\n\n- 14 CC\n\nInstead of a 15 CC build, Either is fine but 14 would be a little quicker for Barracks (1) (2) and Marine (1) that makes defence easier.\n\n- With Gas First allows for Factory (1) at the same time as Orbital Commands (1) (2); usually for Reactor Hellion Opening\n\n- With Gas First allows for Factory (1) at the same time as Orbital Commands (1) (2); usually for Reactor Hellion Opening", "question": "In the Orbital Command Opening, what is the primary purpose of upgrading to Orbital Command early in the game?", "options": ["To immediately build a Starport", "To provide MULEs for economic benefits", "To construct a Barracks faster", "To deploy an additional Supply Depot"], "answer": "To provide MULEs for economic benefits"}

The Marauder's extra damage against Armored units is particularly effective against Stalkers and Colossi. Additionally, Marauder Concussive Shells will prevent a retreating Protoss army from getting too far, then allowing the Terran player to hunt them down if they have enough forces to do so. Approaching Zealots without Charge can be kited with the additional help of Stimpack.\n\nWithout the armor damage bonus, they deal rather less damage to Zealots however, and pure Marauder blobs can be defeated by Zealots with Charge, necessitating the more versatile Marine.

Marauders tend to still be useful in the late-game however when the focus of Terran production is to deal with a Colossi and Stalker ball, where Marauders can be clean-up duty with Vikings hunting Colossi.\n\nMarauders can be even more effective when their attack bonus is combined with the benefits of a Ghost's EMP to take down heavy units like the Immortal, demanding less additional Marines.

{"document": "# Feedback\n\nFeedback\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):High Templar\nCost: 50\nRange:10\nResearched from:No research needed\n\nFeedback is an offensive spell cast by the Protoss High Templar. It is cast on an enemy spell caster (cannot be used on buildings), depleting the target's energy pool and dealing 0.5 point of damage for each energy lost. Feedback can only be cast on units with energy.\n\n## Use\n\nIn competitive play, Feedback is used to snipe enemy spell casters, either weakening them by eliminating their energy or by outright killing them with the damage it can cause. Doing so will give the Protoss player an extreme advantage as they will not have to worry about hazardous spells such as EMP Round.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nSusceptible Units: High Templar, Sentry, Phoenix, Oracle, Mothership Core, Mothership\n\nFeedback is not used as commonly against a Protoss opponent, as the only viable targets are the Sentry and the High Templar. Because of this, the High Templar is much more likely to use its energy for Psi Storm rather than Feedback. The Mothership is also a possible target, should the High Templar be able to get in range against the Mothership's supporting army. Feedback is also an appropriate counter to Oracle harass.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nSusceptible Units: Ghost, Thor (only in Wings of Liberty), Banshee, Medivac, Battlecruiser (only pre Patch 3.8.0), Raven, Point Defense Drone (removed with Patch 4.0.0)\n\nAgainst a Terran opponent, a High Templar will try to use Feedback to snipe the enemy's Ghosts. Because of the danger that Ghosts pose to Protoss armies, it is important to try and use Feedback on any and all Ghosts to weaken them. This is difficult to accomplish though, as an EMP will prevent the opportunity for Feedback to be used at all. Taking a watchtower outside the opponents natural can help the player target ghosts if the Terran moves out.\n\nIt can also be useful to use Feedback on Medivacs or Banshees in order to inhibit their healing or cloaking.\n\nIt can deal damage to Thors and prevent them from using their 250mm Strike Cannons on e.g. Immortals.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nSusceptible Units: Infestor, Overseer, Queen, Viper\n\nFeedback is a rarely used spell in PvZ matchups owing to the enormous strength of Psi Storms against Zerg unit clusters. However, it does come into play against Vipers, Infestors and Overseers. Vipers are very vulnerable as they can be killed in one shot if their energy reaches 150. Infestors have only 90HP and up to 200 energy; in addition, the most commonly-used Infestor spell, Fungal Growth, requires 75 energy. If a Zerg player has Infestors in his mix, it is a safe assumption that they have >75 energy, and thus can be severely weakened if not killed by a Feedback snipe. Overseers are much more robust but a Feedback can still knock out a large portion of their health, making them more vulnerable to Stalker snipe.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nWell placed Force Fields can separate an enemy spell caster from the rest of its army, allowing the High Templar to easily snipe them with Feedback.\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ Blizzard Entertainment (20 November 2018). \"STARCRAFT II 4.7.1 PATCH NOTES\".

{"document": "# Photon Cannon Rush\n## Counters\n### Protoss Counters\n\nThe better way to effectively defend a Cannon Rush as Protoss is to scout the attempted attack in time.[4] Once scouted, the defending player should immediately build their own Forge and immediately start building defensive Cannons slightly out of range of the opponent's Cannons. The aim is to use defensive Cannons to prevent the attacking player from building Cannons within range of any important structures. It's recommended that the defending player maintains parity or exceeds by one the number of Cannons the attacking player has built. The defending player may also use Probes to attack Cannons that are being built, provided there aren't any Cannons in range to protect the building Cannon from attack.[4] Once the opponent gives up their Cannon Rush, continue teching as normal whilst being vigilant against sneaky attempts to resume the rush from another angle.\n\nAnother method that can be used to defend against a cannon rush if the rusher has placed his first pylon far enough away is to rush to a robotics facility. After you have warped in a robotics facility you should warp in two immortals. Near the cannons but out of range, get a probe to warp in a pylon and 2-4 shield batteries. What you want to do now is move the immortal(s) into range and attack one of the cannons. When your immortals are at about 25% shields you should retreat to your shield batteries, charge up your shields and attack again. If you carry on with this the opponent will eventually fall under the merciless assault of immortals.\n\n- Note: It takes one Zealot or three Probes to destroy a Cannon that is being built, if the Cannon is attacked immediately after it is warped in.", "question": "What is the recommended strategy for a defending Protoss player to maintain against an opponent's Cannon Rush in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Build fewer Cannons than the opponent to save resources.", "Build defensive Cannons slightly out of range of the opponent's Cannons.", "Focus on attacking the opponent's Probes instead of their Cannons.", "Ignore the Cannon Rush and continue with the standard build order."], "answer": "Build defensive Cannons slightly out of range of the opponent's Cannons."}

{"document": "# Guardian Shield\n\nGuardian Shield\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):Sentry\nCost: 75\nRange:self\nRadius:4\nDuration:15 s (Sentry)\nResearched from:No research needed\n\n## Description\n\nGuardian Shield is a defensive spell cast by the Protoss Sentry. It creates a shield bubble around the Sentry that reduces the damage of all incoming ranged attacks by 2. Guardian Shield lasts for 15 seconds and only affects friendly units. Friendly buildings are not affected by it.\n\n## Use\n\nGuardian Shield is a support spell used against armies with a primary focus on ranged attacks.\n\nGuardian Shield is the most useful against large numbers of ranged troops that deal smaller amounts of damage and against rapidly firing ranged units. Against larger damage dealing ranged units, Guardian shield, although still useful, is less effective. This means Guardian Shield does not scale well with total ranged damage received as the game progresses.\n\nThe Guardian Shield also underlines \"attribute counters\" which focus on building units that are not vulnerable to the opponent's primary bonus damage. E.g. a Guardian shield only chops 10% off a Marauder's attack against the shields of one of your Stalkers. But if said Marauder has to deal with a Zealot or an Archon, the 2-damage-reduction equals 20%. This can be further improved with a head start on defensive upgrades.\n\nThe Guardian Shield only covers an area with a radius of 4 while the Sentry itself has an attack range of 5. In order to cover friendly melee units such as Zealots, the Sentry should be micro'ed closer to the skirmish.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nGuardian Shield significantly reduces the damage received from Sentries and Void Rays due to the high attack speed of these units. Although a Carrier's Interceptors may not shoot often individually, their combined amount of very small attacks is an excellent application for the Guardian Shield.  One should also not forget the application often seen of this ability in early-mid game PvP pushes.  It greatly reduces the damage of Stalkers, Immortals, and Sentries, which are all staples of an early PvP defense.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nGuardian Shield is very useful against Terran armies as they are primarily composed of ranged attack units. This is especially the case against common Terran armies of Marines/Marauders/Medivacs. In a major engagement with Marines/Marauders/Medivacs it may become necessary to activate multiple guardian shields in quick succession as the casting sentries are often picked off quickly.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Sentry's Guardian Shield can be the difference maker in any encounter against a Mutalisk, Roach, or Hydralisk based army. With the Protoss units already being more durable than most Zerg units, the additional defensive boost can help counteract the massive numbers of a Zerg army.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nWhen used with the Sentry's other spell, the Force Field, a well microed Protoss army can divide its opponent's forces while sustaining heavy amounts of ranged fire. This sort of play allows the Protoss player to dictate how battles will be resolved to a higher degree, all while having a slight ease of mind knowing that the Guardian Shield will support their troops for a brief period of time.\n\n## Other\n\n- Shields friendly units only\n\n- Effects do not stack\n\n- Does not shield friendly ground units on different cliff levels\n\n- Does shield friendly air units as long as their projected position is inside the 4 radius - consider it to be a cylinder rather than a sphere, as the graphic effect suggests\n\n- Does not shield buildings\n\n- As of Patch 1.4.0, all non-melee attacks are being reduced - except for the Planetary Fortress'.

{"document": "# Timing Attack\n\n Timing Attack\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Strategy\n\nA timing attack, or timing push, is an attack that is done during a certain period or moment in time that results in an increased advantage compared to attacking outside that window. The time period in which an attack is stronger than outside the time period is commonly referred to as a timing window. The best timing windows are ones where both player-dependent and opponent-dependent factors coincide (e.g. your upgrade completed, but your opponent's has not. see picture to the right).\n\n## Player-Based Timings\n\n### Tech Completion\n\nAt the completion of an upgrade your army will have a sharp increase in strength. This can be a good time to attack the opponent. As time goes on, the opponent may complete upgrades or get more units evening out the advantage. Another timing is to move out early with one or a few advanced units, using the increased strength of the new unit to make your attack that much stronger.\n\nEven if a timing attack is expected it can be used to force the opponent into spending resources on something else, making other parts of his strategy less powerful. Also known as Forcing.\n\n##### Exceptions\n\n- Some units are more efficient in groups. 3-4 Hydralisks will not boost an attack as much as one Colossus, relative to the army size.\n\n- Scouting can nullify some timing attacks. A Dark Templar timing, for example, will be nullified by proper scouting since the opponent will have countermeasures up in time before the attack hits.\n\n## Opponent-Based Timings\n\nDepending on what your opponent is doing, there will be different \"openings\" or times in his build where it's advantageous to attack.\n\nScouting or knowing timings is critical for opponent-based timing windows.\n\n### Before Tech Completion\n\nIf your opponent is increasing production capacity or investing in upgrades, then your opponent will not be spending resources on units. Until those buildings or upgrades are done, your opponent will have a decrease in production. The largest difference in strength will peak right at the point before the upgrades complete or the new units are done. Delaying attack to the last instant will make it stronger, but the risk of missing the window opportunity will increase.\n\n### Expansion\n\nIf the opponent expands, you might want to consider an attack for two reasons:\n\n- Your opponent has sunk 300-400 minerals into non-army, giving you that much mineral's worth of army advantage and oftentimes positional advantage due to the fact that he must defend the location of his expo. This mineral difference is more significant in the early to mid-game, since 300-400 minerals is a larger percentage of one's income compared to the late-game.\n\n- If you do not \"follow\" him in the economic race by expanding yourself very quickly, your opponent will gain the economic advantage in the near future. Any instance where a player expands, it is somewhat of an ultimatum for the other player to either attack, or quickly expand themselves. Scouting an expansion late puts you in a position where it is probably better to try to attack and knock his economic advantage down, rather than \"following\" him and expanding because the gap would put you in disadvantage anyway. If you scout an expansion going down early, however, you still have a viable option of expanding yourself, since the margin would not be that great.", "question": "Which of the following is NOT a valid reason for conducting a timing attack during an opponent's expansion in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To exploit the mineral investment your opponent has made in the expansion, giving you an army advantage.", "To delay your opponent's economic growth and prevent them from gaining an economic advantage.", "To force your opponent to spend resources on expanding rather than on unit production, thereby weakening their army.", "To take advantage of the opponent's decreased production capacity while they are expanding."], "answer": "To force your opponent to spend resources on expanding rather than on unit production, thereby weakening their army."}

The key is to drop the immortal on the ground as soon as it is ready to attack, and then lift it back into the warp prism before it can receive too much damage from the enemy. It is possible to use other units as well, but the short length of the immortal's attack animation and the relatively long cooldown between attacks (1.45 seconds) makes the immortal an ideal unit for warp prism micro.\n\nThe ideal situation for this micro trick is in around midgame PvZ, when the Protoss has 1-3 immortals, and the Zerg has not yet fielded Mutalisks or Hydralisks.\n\nDemonstration", "question": "Which unit is considered ideal for warp prism micro due to its short attack animation and long cooldown between attacks?", "options": ["Zealot", "Stalker", "Immortal", "Colossus"], "answer": "Immortal"}

{"document": "# Turtling\n\nTurtling is a term commonly used to describe very defensive play, in which the turtling player hides within your opponent's base building up heavy defenses. The term originates from the way turtles use their shell to defend against predators.\n\nTurtling is most often employed by the Terran race, as the Siege Tank's splash and range, Missile Turret's anti-air capabilities, and the Bunker's durability in addition to the ability to be repaired make the Terran defensive incredibly resistant against enemy attacks and ideal for this style of play. However, both Zerg and Protoss races can also engage in turtle-style play with the use of their race-specific static defense buildings which include the Spine Crawler, Spore Crawler, and Photon Cannon, in conjunction with units such as the Mutalisk, Infestor, High Templar, and Sentry. It should be noted, however, that due to the Zerg race mechanics and overall composition it is less than optimal to engage in this style of play as the Zerg race.\n\nTurtling can be countered by disabling the opponent player's ability to expand, slowly draining them of their ability to gain resources.

{"document": "# Mining Minerals\n## General\n### Micromanagement\n\nUnlike in StarCraft: Brood War, workers will automatically spread out among mineral fields. This makes harvesting minerals much easier.\n\nStill, a mineral field can only support a limited amount of workers at a time. In addition, if a worker attempts to mine from a field that is occupied by another worker, that worker will instead select another field to mine from (unless the worker is almost done harvesting from the field). Consequently, players can be found to 'harass' an opponent's mining workers by sending a worker out to mine their minerals. This action prevents the enemy's worker from mining as the field would then be occupied. HuK is particularly notable for this sort of harassment.\n\nAlso, a harvester will sometimes switch to another mineral field if their current field becomes occupied, wasting time traveling instead of mining. Players can remedy this by manually balancing their patches with 2 workers per field, but it may not be worth a player's time to micromanage mining workers as workers will self-balance anyways.\n\nFinally, travel distances vary among mineral fields, with some fields closer to the base than others. Therefore, players may attempt to further maximize mining efficiency by forcing workers to first saturate the closer fields (done by selecting a worker and repeatedly telling it to mine a given field until it starts mining there). Having any more than two workers on a mineral field will force the third worker to move to mine another field instead, unless they are also over-saturated. This strategy is also incentivized because the closer fields have about twice as many minerals, so they will last longer than the smaller/further fields.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the optimal number of workers per mineral field to maximize mining efficiency without causing unnecessary movement?", "options": ["3", "4", "2", "1"], "answer": "2"}

Weak to area of effect attacks (Colossus)) and spells (High Templar unless these units are spread out and Colossus numbers need to be kept low or the splash damage makes Marine numbers impossible to maintain.\n\n- Marauder: Simply put the early game without Marauders is a purely Bunker-defensive one. With Marauders and Concussive Shells the Terran simply outclasses Stalkers and Zealots until Warpgate research completes. The firepower of Marauders into the mid and late game continues being strong against armored-units but need Marines for extra firepower against everything else.\n\n- Ghost: Highly expensive and should not be considered until at least two base economy is started.

{"document": "# 15 Pool Fast Expand\n\n15 Pool Fast Expand\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Opening\n\n## Overview\n\nThe 15 Pool Fast Expand has become the general purpose opening for Zerg players who are trying to get an economic lead. The build is flexible enough to allow for a Queen after the natural Hatchery is planted, as well as several Zerglings to fend off early pressure. The Zerglings can be foregone in favor of Drones as well for increased early economic advantage.\n\n### Goal\n\nTo get down your expansion fast but at a minimal risk of being rushed early on, since static defense was buffed, Spine Crawlers at the expansion can be very useful for defending the Natural Expansion.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| 9 Overlord; 15 Spawning Pool; 16th Drone - Rally to Natural; 16 Hatchery |\n\n- 9 Overlord\n\n- 15 Spawning Pool\n\n- 16th Drone - Rally to Natural\n\n- 16 Hatchery\n\n## Scouting and Adaptation\n\nA 9 Drone scout may be appropriate on some large maps like Kulas Ravine, but on maps with short distances between main bases, a scout after Hatchery may be more appropriate. It's vital to determine exactly which build your opponent is going for and to react accordingly. If you scout that your opponent, regardless of race, is going for a dedicated 1 base bust, then getting a few Spine Crawlers may be prudent. Similarly, against a fast tech build to an air unit such as Banshees or Void Rays, then a rush to Lair and Hydralisks will be necessary, but another tool to make use of is to get two Queens and keep them together to serve as a temporary anti-air solution.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nThe primary factor to look for when playing against Protoss is a 2 Gate, at which point it is necessary to immediately plant a Roach Warren and delay the Protoss as much as possible with Zerglings. Once the Roach Warren pops, then it should be possible to drive back the Zealots.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nTerran might attempt to go for a fast Reaper or fast Marauder build, but that should be scouted with your Drone scout. Against a fast Reaper, the key is to keep the Zerglings on Creep in order to get that extra speed boost against the Reaper. Against Marauders, you should try to surround the Marauder as best you can or force it against an edge so he cannot micro against your Zerglings.\n\n## Countered By\n\n- Proxy Gateway\n\n- Proxy Barracks\n\n- 6 Pool\n\n- 8 Pool\n\n- 10 Pool\n\n## Transition\n\nOnce your Queen is finished, you can transition into any of the following builds:\n\n### Vs.

{"document": "# Mothership Core (Legacy of the Void)\n\nMothership Core\nUnit Information\nType:Air Unit\nBuilt From:Nexus\nRequirements:Cybernetics Core\nCost: Minerals: 100  Vespene Gas: 100  Build Time: 21  2\nAttack 1\nTargets:Ground\nDamage:8 (+1)\nDPS:13.1 (+1.64)\nCooldown:0.61\nRange:5\nUnit stats\nDefense: Hit Points: 130  60  Armor: 1 (+1)\nAttributes:Mechanical, Armored, Psionic\nEnergy:50 / 200\nSight:9\nSpeed:2.62\n\n- Cybernetics Core\n\n## Description\n\nThe Mothership Core was a flying support caster for the Protoss that could be built from the Nexus once the Cybernetics Core is finished. Its primary roles were base defence and army support.\nLike the Mothership, the Mothership Core was a unique unit that a player can only have one of at any time. It could be upgraded to a Mothership once the Fleet Beacon has been built.\n\nIt was removed from Multiplayer in Patch 4.0.0.\n\n## Abilities\n\nUpgrade To Mothership\nCaster: Mothership Core Minerals: 300 Vespene Gas: 300 6\nDuration: 71\nUpgrades into the Mothership. Can use Photon Overcharge, Mass Recall and Time Warp. Cloaks nearby units and structures.\n\n## Spells\n\nPhoton Overcharge\nCaster: Mothership Core, Mothership 50\nRange: 7\nDuration: 14s\nHas to be cast on a Pylon. It grants the Pylon the ability to attack air and ground units and buildings for 30 damage and a range of 7 with a weapon speed of 0.714.\n\nMass Recall\nCaster: Mothership Core, Mothership 50\nDuration: 2 s\nRadius: 6.5\nTeleports the Mothership Core or Mothership and all the nearby units (within a 6.5 radius) owned by the player to the targeted Nexus.\n\nTime Warp\nCaster: Mothership\nRange: 9\nCooldown: 60\nDuration: 9\nRadius: 3.75\nAfter a 0.71 second delay, warps spacetime within the target area for 7 seconds. Enemy units and structures within the field will have attack and movement speeds reduced by 40%.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\n- The Mothership Core was occasionally used in All-Ins and 4-Gates.\n\n- Time Warp gives Protoss more opportunity to attack and retreat from more mobile armies, like the Marauder's Concussive Shells ability. Previously Protoss did not have any straight forward abilities or spells to choose engagements beyond simple micro, but this and the Mothership Core's Mass Recall simplifies this task for Protoss in Heart of the Swarm.\n\n- In early game PvP, the ability to use Photon Overcharge on the defending player's Pylons effectively means that the defender's advantage now exists in the early game of this match-up, which wasn't the case in Wings of Liberty because of the ability for the attacking player to warp in units inside (or very close to) the defender's base through the use of Pylons. Additionally, since Heart of the Swarm, the defender's advantage provided by High Ground is partially negated by the attacker's own Mothership Core, since the unit can see up cliffs.\n\n- In later game, the Mass Recall ability can be useful to quickly move the army to an attacked base or expansion or to escape from an unfavorable engagement.\n\n- The Mothership Core is useful against Terran also in the early game and allows players to be much greedier, as Marine/SCV ground aggression and Widow Mine, Hellbat/Hellion or Marine/Marauder drops can both be defended quite well with the Photon Overcharge ability.\n\n- Against Zerg the Mothership Core can be effective in early game defense as all Zerg tier 1 units (Zerglings, Roaches and Banelings) cannot attack air, and so the Mothership Core can attack such units with impunity. Queens are effective against the Mothership Core however they are very unlikely and impractical to use in early game aggression.", "question": "Which ability of the Mothership Core allows it to teleport itself and nearby units to a targeted Nexus?", "options": ["Photon Overcharge", "Mass Recall", "Time Warp", "Upgrade To Mothership"], "answer": "Mass Recall"}

You want to play the role of the defender more so than usual. In an ideal world, you should know that the Zerg has chosen to go Roach/Hydra well before you have made too many Widow Mines. In that case, begin making Tanks out of two (or even three) Factories. Realistically, you will often have to switch your mindset very quickly in a game when you find out he went for this composition. In such a case, do not hesitate! Switch your Factory to a Tech Lab and get a second Factory started. It is a good decision to go more Marauder heavy in a situation like this (up to four Tech Lab Marauders instead of the normal single Tech Lab Barracks).\n\nIf you have the multitasking and feel good about your defense, you can opt to do some drops. This is, however, risky as, unless the Zerg overextends, the opponent will be able to take advantage of some mid-game timings where his army is able to either break your third base or force way too much to be lost in holding it.\n\nYour overall goal is to build an extremely cost effective army and hit a timing while he is transitioning to Hive. Once you have acquired around 170-180 food and six or more Tanks, you can begin to push out. If he has not started a Hive yet, do not push even at this timing. Keep the goal of hitting him before Hive tech in mind at all times. An army based around six to ten Tanks is simply impossible for a Roach/Hydra army to fight on even terms. Do not get out of position and make sure to hit before he is able to change his composition, but not a minute sooner.\n\nIf, for some reason, you enter into the mid game with a sizable advantage and the Zerg goes for a Roach/Hydra play, you can transition into pure bio.

The rocks can be attacked by any unit that can attack ground units and will crumble and give way once their health reaches zero. Like all buildings, Destructible Rocks have the Structure attribute, meaning that they will take additional damage from Nukes and Banelings.\n\nDestructible Debris is a mere visual variation commonly used on maps using the Urban and Space Platform tilesets in place of Destructible Rocks.\n\n## Notable Uses\n\n- Blocking backdoor entrances of main bases or key expansions, leaving them a lot more vulnerable once the rocks are destroyed.\n\n- At (usually gold) expansions blocking the spot a Command Center, Hatchery or Nexus would have to be placed for optimal resource gathering.\n\n- Blocking access to expansion areas which are effectively islands until the rocks are destroyed.\n\n- Blocking shortcut paths between two main bases.\n\n- (Wings of Liberty only): Allowing Void Rays to easily build up their charge for a more powerful attack on a nearby base.

This list is useful, for instance, if you want to figure out how many Marines you need to send to kill a set of rocks if you need the area to be cleared in a certain foreseeable amount of time.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Zerg\n## Early Game\n### Standard 14 Pool\n#### Situations\n\nIf your Opponent pulls Drones with his Zerglings\nYou must cancel your natural Hatchery. Generally, your goal here is simply to stall until you are able to get a sizable number of Zerglings/Queen/Spine Crawlers. Be sure to also cancel any Spine Crawlers being built before your opponent's Zerglings/Drones get to your base - any delay helps!  When your opponent's Zerglings/Drones enter your base, mineral walk your Drones to your natural mineral patch, build a Queen, and build Zerglings. Try to sneak one of your Drones behind your mineral line before hand to build a Spine Crawler. As a general rule, when your Queen pops you can fight your opponent. You will have 8-10 Zerglings, and more Drones. Continue to rally Zerglings and micro as best as possible (pull back injured Zerglings/Drones, etc.).

Hydralisks are effective versus Ultralisks without Chitinous Plating assuming no upgrades (or upgrades that cancel each other out). However, with Chitinous Plating, Ultralisks can beat Hydralisks. Yet again, as numbers get larger, Hydralisk effectiveness increases, since several layers of ranged units can attack, compared to one layer for melee units. Ultralisk splash effect helps to counteract this disadvantage somewhat, but it is often not enough.\n\nWhile Lurker heavy styles are usually favored in a frontal engagement, Ultralisks mobility means that the Ultralisk player can often avoid such engagements and either look for a surround or split up and attack the Lurker player's expansions.

{"document": "# Adel's Late Gas (vs. Protoss)\n## Execution\n### Expanding\n\nYou have a couple options while expanding. First, you can expand while you are attacking with your four Zealots and two Stalkers, following this up with two more Gateways and a Forge. This will allow you to have 4 Warpgates worth of production (to match your enemy's), along with a couple Photon Cannons at your natural. A single Photon Cannon is usually sufficient if you have been able to knock some Probes out. You really cannot skip this Photon Cannon! These Photon Cannon(s) are extremely cost efficient, so much so that a Photon Cannon will be able to protect your natural better than a Stalker, or a Zealot. The Photon Cannon is also great for detection against DT rushes or builds.\n\nYour second option is to add on your two (or three - Adelscott often gets 5 Warpgates then expands) additional Gateways, and then expand. This delays the expansion but allows you combat a 4 Warpgate Rush if you weren't able to deal sufficient damage. Also, if you add on your Warpgates before expanding, in case you cannot hold your expansion, you can cancel the Nexus and fall back up your ramp. Worst case scenario: you end up with more Probes than the other guy, and 4 Warpgates. I would not recommend transitioning into 2 Gate Robotics, as you will not have the vespene to support robo units. Adelscott often constructs five Warpgates, so that with Chrono Boost and his Natural Expansion, your opponent will eventually out-produce an enemy four or five Warpgate Rush.\n\nIf you killed enough Probes and you get your Natural up and running, you can build a Robo. You have to take your gas earlier then. This very much depends on your scouting information.\n\nNote: Oftentimes sufficient damage is not able to be dealt. In this scenario you need 5 Gateways with constant boost on your Warpgate research. While your additional Gateways are being constructed, use the completed Gateways to construct additional Zealots and Stalkers. You'll be able to survive then out-produce an ordinary 4 Gate due to your extra probes and Warpgates.\n\nSince you'll be taking a very quick expansion, you'll have a greater income than usual, and as such you are allowed leeway in what you spend your money on. Since you already have a Forge, it's great to start chronoboosting +1 weapons once your Photon Cannon(s) are up.\n\nAfter you have a decent saturation of minerals at your natural you can add on as many Assimilators as you like. A possible transition is mass Blink Stalkers followed by Archons. In this case you might like to add on all three Assimilators at once, and then throw down a Twilight Council. The Twilight Council is usually the best avenue to choose, if you like to harass with Blink. Keep in mind, that you already have a ratio of 3:3:1 in terms of Gateway units, the 1 being Sentries (explained in the #Key Notes section).", "question": "Why is it important to build at least one Photon Cannon at your natural expansion in the Adel's Late Gas strategy against Protoss?", "options": ["It is crucial for protecting your expansion from enemy attacks and is more cost-efficient than units.", "It is necessary for producing more Warpgates.", "It increases your mineral income.", "It is required to research Chrono Boost."], "answer": "It is crucial for protecting your expansion from enemy attacks and is more cost-efficient than units."}

{"document": "# Hotkeys\n## Overview\n### Benefits of Using Hotkeys\n\nA keyboard, although blunt, is a faster and more precise and exact instrument than a mouse; thus, hotkeys offer fast, precise, and exact execution of commands. A mouse must be navigated across the screen to execute commands; even assuming a very high DPI setting and perfect accuracy on the part of the player, clicking the mouse button still takes approximately the same amount of time as pressing a key. Thus, using a hotkey is always faster than using the mouse.\n\nImagine that the Red Player is using hotkeys, and the Blue Player is not. Let us assume that Blue is adept at using her mouse, and Red is equally adept at using his hotkeys. Blue's actions will typically take her 100ms (milliseconds; 1,000ms = one second) longer than Red. In a ten-minute game, assuming Blue has an APM of 120, her choice to neglect hotkeys adds up to 1.2 wasted seconds per minute. Very few players can control the mouse with the accuracy and celerity requisite to execute commands with only a 100ms delay over hotkeys; for most players neglecting hotkeys, the lost time balloons wildly out of control, and can be measured in minutes, not seconds.\n\nWorse, certain actions can only be performed with hotkeys. For instance, control groups, base centering, and camera bookmarks are not accessible via the mouse. To demonstrate this, let's say that our two players are Terran, and have sent out an SCV to scout the enemy. While scouting they determine that they need more Marines.\n\nBlue (who does not use the keyboard) would need to:\n\n- look at the lower left quadrant of her monitor\n\n- position the cursor over the minimap\n\n- click on the minimap to reposition the camera\n\n- look back at the main part of the monitor\n\n- click on the Barracks\n\n- look at the lower right quadrant of the monitor\n\n- position the cursor over the command card\n\n- click on the Marine button\n\n- look back at the lower left quadrant of her monitor\n\n- position the cursor over the minimap\n\n- click on the mini-map to zoom over to her scout\n\n- position the cursor over the scout\n\n- click on her scout\n\nCompare that to Red, who has assigned the 4 hotkey to his SCV and the 5 hotkey to his Barracks. To perform the same actions, he would just need to:\n\n- Press 5\n\n- Press A\n\n- Press 4\n\nRed would not even look at his base. He would use 4 to select his SCV again, and could press 44 to center his screen on the SCV.\n\nClearly, Red's play will be faster and more efficient at all levels.", "question": "Which of the following actions can only be performed with hotkeys in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Building a new unit", "Scouting with an SCV", "Using control groups", "Attacking an enemy"], "answer": "Using control groups"}

{"document": "# Planetary Fortress Rush\n## Basic Build Order\n### Notes\n\n- While it is possible to try and wall off to block scouting (this would still give away the early E-Bay), optimal timing wise it is better to begin buildings as soon as resources allow, thus walling off is not a requirement.\n\n- It is possible to proxy/hide the E-Bay to keep your opponent in the dark.\n\n- While technically you only require 150 minerals and 150 gas, it is advisable to get a small portion of extra gas, as you will need it for repairing the Command Center. Usually you will have around 400-500 minerals at the 4:30 lift-off time. Do not push the gas past 200 however, as any further is wasting too much time. Note: you can order all your SCVs to mine gas while the Command Center is in the air, so that they can immediately return the gas once it lands.\n\n- An early Refinery build is also feasible for this strategy.  However it is important to note that if you build an early Refinery, if your opponent were to scout it, in all likelihood  they would sacrifice early economy to get more defences - thus this \"standard\" style opening has a slightly higher chance of succeeding.", "question": "In the Planetary Fortress Rush strategy, what is the recommended gas amount to have by the 4:30 lift-off time?", "options": ["Less than 150", "Around 200", "Over 300", "Exactly 150"], "answer": "Around 200"}
{"document": "# Observer (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### General\n\nAs a general rule, the Observer should be acquired as soon as feasible in all builds, and should usually be the first unit produced out of the Robotics Facility unless there is a pressing need for fast Immortals. Many players choose to Chrono Boost their Observer, as it provides defensive detection and invaluable scouting information on the opponent's army. Normally this first Observer is positioned at the choke of the opponent's base after completing scouting, as this is where most players mass up their armies before heading out.\n\nIn all matchups it is wise to get Observers for detection, to provide vision of high ground areas during attacks, and for scouting throughout the match. This battlefield knowledge of enemy movements and tech choices is of paramount importance, and can help you prepare for an impending attack or provide you with an excellent opportunity to hit a vulnerable base.\n\nBecause of their sight range is significantly greater than any attack range of static defense, Observers can and should avoid being taken down in this way. However, the detection range of these buildings matches the observer (when not in surveillance mode), which means that if your Observer can see static defense, it is visible to the enemy (sight ranges are all 11). This also implies that the only real threats to Observers are scan and mobile detection.\n\nDuring the mid or late game Observers are often used to keep tabs on an opponents tech route or progress and also their economic situation, especially vs Zerg, to keep tabs on the number of bases that have been taken and the level of saturation on each. Multiple (2-3) observers will usually travel with the army to ensure some redundancy in case they get picked off, and can be split off to points of interest as required.", "question": "In StarCraft II, why is it important to position the first Observer at the choke of the opponent's base after scouting?", "options": ["To provide a defensive barrier against ground attacks", "To provide vision of high ground areas during attacks and scout enemy movements", "To upgrade the Observer's detection range", "To increase the Observer's speed for faster scouting"], "answer": "To provide vision of high ground areas during attacks and scout enemy movements"}

{"document": "# Worker Rush\n## Overview\n\nA worker rush is a cheese wherein you take all of your starting SCV's/Probes/Drones to the enemy base and attack. It can be done with any race, though Zerg is typically the strongest, with Protoss in second, both due to their natural regeneration. Terran is typically weakest, as Repair requires minerals, which thus requires at least 1 SCV left behind.\n\nThe problem with a worker rush is that if your opponent has built even one more worker, your attack force will be outnumbered. The correct counter in most cases, is for the defending player to select all their workers, attack move, and win via numbers. There does not tend to be much art to microing worker combat, so it's difficult to claim to consistently defeat 8 enemy workers with 6 of your own.\n\nThere is exactly one build which this approach might legitimately counter: a 6 pool. As the Zerg player will not build workers, and further drop to 5 workers after placing the pool, a worker rush - especially with a 7th helper worker sent along afterward - might work given a short rush distance. Of course, by definition, 6 pools cannot be scouted, so this relies on knowing your opponent and reading their strategy from the onset. Against any other build, the only hope is a distracted / confused defender who does not set your opponent's workers to attack.\n\nThis should not be confused with worker harass, where a scout attacks workers (in particular, SCVs) in the opponent's base to distract them and possibly force a stop on the building.\n\nAlternatively versus Terran on maps with short rush distances like Steppes of War, Zerg can worker rush with 12 Drones by doing a double Extractor Trick. This exploits the timing window where Terran cannot build workers for a few seconds before their Supply Depot finishes as well as denying their Barracks. Since buildings like Gateways and Spawning Pools cannot be denied effectively, this strategy is unlikely to work versus Protoss or Zerg.", "question": "In StarCraft II, which race is typically the weakest for performing a worker rush due to the requirement of minerals for repair?", "options": ["Zerg", "Protoss", "Terran", "All races are equally weak"], "answer": "Terran"}

{"document": "# Queen (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Queen is the heart of Zerg production in this match-up. Since each Queen is worth more in production than an additional Hatchery and because Queens are often so vulnerable, sniping enemy Queens can provide a significant advantage early on. Since ZvZ tends to be the shortest of all match-ups, forcing the opponent to spend an additional 150 minerals, lose 1 round of injection, and spend 50 seconds build time puts the aggressor at a massive advantage.\n\nIt also becomes necessary, then, to make sure the Queen is protected. Although Spine Crawlers are decent at defense, they are not enough to stop a flood of Zerglings from destroying the Queen. Therefore, the most common way of defending a Queen is to surround it with a Roach wall (with the Queen and Roaches on hold position), as Queens require very little movement to do their work.\n\nDrones may also be right clicked onto the Queen, causing them to circle around the Queen. This causes enemy Zerglings to circle around the Drones because their targeting AI will prioritize the attacking Queen and not the non-attacking Drones. This will require your opponent to individually target Drones or hold position in order to attack them.\n\nIf the opponent does not remove their scouting Overlord from your base, the Queen should be able to kill the Overlord with relative ease.", "question": "In a Zerg versus Zerg match-up, what is a common method to protect a Queen from being destroyed by enemy Zerglings?", "options": ["Using a Roach wall", "Deploying Spine Crawlers alone", "Surrounding the Queen with Drones", "Building additional Hatcheries"], "answer": "Using a Roach wall"}

For example, looking at the high ground of a Terran Supply Depot Wall-In to scout addons. This is especially strong against a Reaper and to an extent a Reactor Hellion opening which both rely on the Reactor.\n\n- Adepts have the potential to snowball in PvT against bio, particularly against drop play and/or when paired with the gas heavy Phoenix.

{"document": "# Reaper (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\n- A single unupgraded Reaper beats a single unupgraded Marine but will quickly die from 2 marines if not microed. At the same time, one reaper cost more than 2 marines. Marines and Reapers have the same range which makes it difficult for the reapers to harass SCVs guarded by marines or the marines themselves. Finally, marines become a much more viable unit in the mid- and late-game than the reaper due to the stimpack ability. This makes reapers very cost inefficient against marines. Marauders are also decent against reapers when they have the concussive shells because this makes it difficult for the wounded reapers to escape from combat. Hellions and Siege Tanks are also effective against reapers because they do heavy area damage and because the Hellions to bonus damage to reapers. Any air unit that can attack ground is also effective against reapers since reapers only can attack ground units. As a result, reapers are rarely a viable unit in TvT.\n\n- A little bit slower than Hellions, but has way higher DPS than a hellion if not AOE'd.

Terran\n\nWarp Prisms can be used to drop inexpensive units, such as Probes or Zealots, onto enemy Siege Tanks to inflict splash damage on your opponent's units. This technique is similar to the Bombing technique in StarCraft.\n\nWarp Prisms can be used to carry High Templar, this is beneficial both because the slow moving Templar cannot keep up with Stalkers and Zealots equipped with their charge upgrade and because a (cloaked) Ghost could EMP all of the Templar at once.

{"document": "# 2 Base Templar (vs. Terran)\n## Defending the Third and Transitioning\n\nDefending your third is a matter of correct positioning, good micro, and good scouting. In general, Templar are much stronger defensively than Colossi, despite having less potential for straight up attacks (more on this later).\n\nAt this point, you should have four Observers out on the map keeping watch on the Terran. I like to keep three close to my bases-watching for drops and pushes while having one out scouting what he’s doing. The things you are looking for are his third CC as well as its timing; additionally, check for more opportunities to sneak Zealots/DTs in his main and/or third.\n\nAs a general rule:\n\n- 3Rax >> CC >> 5Rax means light aggression after the Medivac push and a more passive Terran until his 2/2 completes.\n\n- 3Rax >> 5Rax >> CC means heavy aggression coming your way.\n\n- 5Rax and no 3rd CC means a likely incoming two-base all-in, with an SCV pain-train.\n\nThe remaining 3 Observers should be moved in key locations to watch your bases and make sure you know where his army is.\n\nStart a second Forge when you see him taking a third, get ready for the longer game with Colossus/Blink tech or go for a timing if you want to finish the game faster.\n\nTransitioning into Colossus is fairly game dependent. If your opponent is being very aggressive, you'll want to transition more slowly. Get a good Gateway count up first (8-10) and making sure you have good drop defense ready with 1-2 Cannons and a Templar in position. Going double Robo is risky against a very aggressive opponent and many Korean pros prefer sticking to a single Robotics Facility for a while. On the other hand, you can go double Robo before extra gates if he’s playing very passively, your harassment did lots of damage, you are ahead because you killed many of his Medivacs, or you've successfully defended an aggressive frontal push.\n\nAt this point it’s vital to buy as much time as possible for your econ and second tech to kick in: remain active with your harassment. It's important to replace the Warp Prism if you lost it earlier on. You can start mixing in Storm drops as well, which are devastating against an unprepared or slow opponent. Get Pylons on the map, especially near his third and fourth, and warp in Zealots from there. Your Robo time isn’t free anymore as you switch to Colossus. Once you move to Colossus, you can’t afford to remake Warp Prisms as easily, especially off a single Robo. If you are having trouble getting Probes out because his units keep sniping them, you can poke out a bit on the map with your main army.\n\nAs you get close to maxing out you also want to tech to Blink while trading away a few Zealots for more gas intensive units like Colossi, Archons, extra Templars spread all over the map, and a group of Blink Stalkers: keep up the run-bys and harassment!\n\nA second possibility is to not go for Colossus for a while and stick to pure Gateway units for longer, going up to 11-12 Gates. This is harder to pull off and much more micro intensive, but if you are either ahead from the early/midgame or he’s still two-basing you, it can be a strong option. If you want to finish the game faster, try to use your Warp Prism to draw him out of position while going for a strong three-base, mass Warpgate attack before he can get enough Ghosts or Hellbats to stop your Templar army. With this style you can play more aggressively, harass for longer and deny the Terran’s fourth while taking your own; but do note, your maxed army will be weaker than with a Colossus switch. Eventually you are forced into having both area of effect units: get Colossus tech after taking your fourth at the latest.", "question": "What should you prioritize when transitioning into Colossus if your opponent is being very aggressive?", "options": ["Building more Observers", "Going for a double Robotics Facility", "Getting a good Gateway count first", "Focusing on Pylon placement"], "answer": "Getting a good Gateway count first"}

{"document": "# Macro\n## Race-Specific Mechanics\n### Zerg\n#### Quick Mass Injection Keystroke\n\nA quick way to inject all Hatcheries with Larvae is by assigning all queens to one hotkey (0 or 9 is recommended for this method), then pressing V, then from this point on you hold the Shift key, then alternate between pressing Backspace and clicking the center of your screen.\n\n0 (hotkey for all Queens), V, hold Shift, Backspace, click, Backspace click, (etc.)\n\n- 0 is pressed with the index finger.\n\n- V is pressed with the pinky\n\n- right Shift is held down with the thumb\n\n- Backspace is pressed repeatedly with the index finger.\n\nAs you may know, holding shift preserves a command, like when building structures or casting abilities. The same can be applied to the Queen's Larvae inject ability. Backspace centers your screen over the next Hatchery/Nexus/CC and clicking the center of your screen while having the larvae inject ability preserved injects. Because you have all Queens selected, and because SC2's smart-casting AI, the nearest Queen will be told to inject Larvae to the targeted Hatchery as you alternate between pressing Backspace and click.\n\nThis method can inject all Larvae on all Hatcheries extremely quickly. And additional Hatcheries hardly cost additional time.\n\nCaveat:\nWhen a Queen does not have sufficient energy, the next nearest Queen with sufficient energy will move to inject the targeted Hatchery. This may result in a Queen traveling across the map, putting herself in danger, and missing out on 2 Hatcheries' injection cycles. Prevention measures are: 1) having extra Queens above the number of Hatcheries in play and positioning them near Queens that might have to use transfuse and run out of energy; 2) or simply having enough awareness to make sure your Queens do have sufficient energy can prevent this unwanted scenario.", "question": "In StarCraft II, which keystroke combination allows for quick mass injection of all Hatcheries using Queens?", "options": ["0, V, hold Shift, Backspace, click", "1, B, hold Ctrl, Delete, click", "2, N, hold Alt, Space, click", "3, M, hold Shift, Enter, click"], "answer": "0, V, hold Shift, Backspace, click"}

{"document": "# Adept\n## Description\n\nAdepts are \"highly trained battlefield commanders\", warped in at the Gateway after the Cybernetics Core has finished.\nThey were first introduced in Legacy of the Void.\n\nDespite their low rate of fire, Adepts can punch a hole through Lightly-armored targets. In addition, they can project a Shade of themselves, a controllable copy of the Adept that is immune but which exists for a brief time. Once this timer is up, the original Adept will teleport to the location of the shade, or the shade can be cancelled and preserve the location of the Adept. Due to the speed and immortality of the shade, this makes for an ideal scout. The ability can also be used for more offensive purposes. If the shade(s) are sent into the base of an opponent, it may require the opponent to split their army to deal with the possibility of the shade(s) expiring and the Adepts dealing damage. If Adepts are used for extensive damage-dealing, it may be desirable to research the Resonating Glaives upgrade from the Twilight Council, increasing Adept attack speed.\n\nTwo defining features of developed armies in Starcraft are either they are extremely mobile but lacking power or powerful with less mobility. Two Stargate units the Phoenix and Oracle can harass where Adepts cannot, all three combined are even capable of defending almost all threats from both Terran and Zerg from the early to mid game. See Versus Protoss for why Adepts are not common there.\n\nAdepts have no anti-air attack and are commonly produced alongside Stargate units like a few Oracles and many Phoenix.

After that, or if you're blocked, spread the Observers throughout the map to scout for army movements. One patrolling Observer is a good way to scout for hidden expansions.\n\n- With the Sentry upgrade Hallucination, you can summon a Phoenix or an other high mobility unit do scouting for the duration of the spell. In Wings of Liberty, this is a cheap (100 ) and safe way to scout your opponent's base without having to worry about losing a unit. However, if you do not get a Robotics Facility any time soon, Hallucination would be cheaper and faster than getting a Robotics Facility and an Observer. There is also the benefit of potentially deceiving your opponent of a false tech route. In Heart of the Swarm, Hallucination no longer requires research.\n\n- Another option for mid to late game scouting is the Dark Templar. Even though it should first and foremost be viewed as an offensive unit for the Protoss, if it is blocked by an Overseer, Missile Turret or Observer it can be left outside the opponent's choke to catch lone SCVs, Probes or Drones and scout army movements. It should also be mentioned that this is a far less economical choice to make.", "question": "Which Protoss unit or ability is described as a cheap and safe way to scout the opponent's base without risking the loss of a unit, especially in Wings of Liberty?", "options": ["Observer", "Hallucination", "Dark Templar", "Sentry"], "answer": "Hallucination"}

{"document": "# Unit Positioning\n## General Ideas Behind Unit Positioning & Flanking\n### Concave\n\nThe concave unit position is the most aggressive stance. It is a curved position which allows all of your units to focus fire on a unit contained in the center point outside of the concave curve (hereafter referred to as \"center point\"). While being the most aggressive stance, it is also the weakest to flanking. Attempting to attack the enemy from the center point will maximize the enemy's damage. However, attacking from either side (the top or the bottom) allows you to attack each unit one at a time which vastly increases your DPS. Furthermore, attacking a concave from the behind also increases your DPS due to fighting a convex curve (see below), but the advantage is not nearly as good as attacking from one of the more vulnerable sides.\n\nThere are some units which perform very well against concave curves - the most notable one being the Colossus because its attack naturally follows a concave curve across the battlefield. As such, a Colossus maximizes its damage when fighting a concave curve and is the sole exception to fighting from within the center point.", "question": "Which unit performs exceptionally well against a concave curve due to its attack pattern?", "options": ["Zealot", "Colossus", "Marine", "Zergling"], "answer": "Colossus"}
{"document": "# Viking (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nIn TvT, they are used to hold off the opponent's Vikings, Ravens, and Liberators.\nTvT often revolves around getting Siege Tanks and Vikings very early on. While the Tanks do most of the damage, the Vikings give increased sight so that the Tanks can utilize their full range.\n\nAir dominance is a very important aspect of TvT, as whoever has control of the air will get both the range bonus for his Tanks and the ability to protect his own Ravens, Liberators, and Battlecruisers. In the early mid-game they can also be used for harassing the opponent's mineral line, and in some cases they can supplement the Terran's ground army. Landing them on top of an opponent's sieged Tanks to force them to damage one another is also a popular technique. Another option is to land them on unreachable cliffs, to fire at troops underneath them, especially when the enemy doesn't have air units providing sight.\n\nVikings are often a key aspect of TvT all game long as they have no clear counter. Thors can be used to keep Vikings at bay, but Thors deal low damage against non-light, non-massive air units, so they don't kill Vikings very easily. Battlecruisers can be a viable option in the late game, but as Vikings have longer range, are cheaper and faster to build, Battlecruisers (especially without Yamato Cannon) do not trade against them cost-effectively.", "question": "In a Terran versus Terran match-up, why are Vikings crucial for maintaining air dominance?", "options": ["Because they can quickly mine minerals and gas, giving an economic advantage.", "Because they provide increased sight, allowing Siege Tanks to utilize their full range.", "Because they are the only unit that can destroy the opponent's Command Center.", "Because they can transform into Battlecruisers, providing a late-game advantage."], "answer": "Because they provide increased sight, allowing Siege Tanks to utilize their full range."}
{"document": "# Post-Youth LE\n\nPost-Youth LEMap Information\nCreator:depressed1\nSize:116x144\nSpawn Positions:2 at 1,7\nCompetition Span:2024-03-07 — Present\nRush distance:30 seconds1v1 Ladder:2024-03-26 — Present\n\nPost-Youth is a 2-player map.\n\nSubmitted to the TLMC powered by Shopify\nCreated by depressed1\n\n## Official Description\n\nPost-Youth is a 4-level freestyle category short distance map. In the first place the map was created in order to diversify mirror match-ups with absence of a natural base (in combination with small rush distance). Instead of that you have a double main base with an additional double sideway ramp blocked by a mineral wall (20 minerals per patch). Thanks to the hybrid base, you can diversify your build orders (Nexus or hatchery first, lifting CC, etc.).\n\n- All standards and privileges to all races work normally.\n\n- The fourth level was introduced to make late game more challenging. Golden base was pushed to the low ground and forward for the same reasons.\n\n- The bases after the third are all on low grounds and they are more open. Initially, the center of the map is blocked by rocks.\n\n- Watchtowers at the center are initially blocked by rocks. It gives you an option to exchange a choke point in front of the triangle third base with safe vision.\n\n## Additional Description by the creator\n\nThis map is following up on an experiment from TLMC#18. In TLMC#18 map Shipping News re-introduced the hybrid mineral base. A 6-patch (3 gold, 3 blue) hybrid base has the same mineral income as a “normal” base but with less workers needed. It requires additional micro at the beginning to saturate such a base right. This should work as an opportunity to get more macro oriented and defensible openings.\n\nThe map promotes safer but active midgame with a variety of options to flank and counter attack opponents.\nThe double main was specifically designed to overcome multiple problems that may be caused by liberators, rippers, DTs, burrowed roaches. But at the same time the map invites you to play proxy starport hellion drops and banshees, proxy stargate double oracles, nydus worm swarm hosts and other aggressive macro focused build orders.\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Post-Youth LE15238162242.1%36171947.2%42132931.0%19125\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Post-Youth LE | 152 | 38 | 16 | 22 | 42.1% | 36 | 17 | 19 | 47.2% | 42 | 13 | 29 | 31.0% | 19 | 12 | 5 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2024-04-262024-08-11\nWorld Team League 2024 Summer2024-05-022024-06-272024 Global StarCraft II League Season 2: Code S2024-05-312024-06-02\nESL SC2 Masters 2024 Spring2024-05-182024-05-19\nStars\nWar 112024-04-102024-05-05\nESL SC2 Masters 2024 Spring: Europe2024-02-292024-04-112024 Global StarCraft II League Season 1: Code S\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2024-04-26 | 2024-08-11 |  | World Team League 2024 Summer |\n| 2024-05-02 | 2024-06-27 |  | 2024 Global StarCraft II League Season 2: Code S |\n| 2024-05-31 | 2024-06-02 |  | ESL SC2 Masters 2024 Spring |\n| 2024-05-18 | 2024-05-19 |  | StarsWar 11 |\n| 2024-04-10 | 2024-05-05 |  | ESL SC2 Masters 2024 Spring: Europe |\n| 2024-02-29 | 2024-04-11 |  | 2024 Global StarCraft II League Season 1: Code S |\n\n## Translations", "question": "What feature of the Post-Youth LE map design allows for a variety of aggressive macro-focused build orders?", "options": ["The natural base with a large rush distance", "The double main base with an additional double sideway ramp blocked by a mineral wall", "The central rocks blocking the watchtowers", "The fourth level that makes the late game more challenging"], "answer": "The double main base with an additional double sideway ramp blocked by a mineral wall"}
{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Zerg\n## Early Game\n### Fast Spawning Pool\n#### Follow-ups: Moving into the Mid Game\n\nAs a general guideline, if you killed more than two Drones or cancelled their Hatchery, you are ahead; if you forced a Drone pull but killed only one or two, you are even; if you forced a Drone pull but did not kill any and the Hatchery stands, you are far behind.\n\n- If you are ahead: We suggest going for two base Mutalisks. When the player that is ahead goes for fast Mutalisks, it allows him to start a snowball effect that will result in a massive supply lead. You will have far more time than normal to get your damage done before your opponent gets out Infestors or Mutalisks of their own (in which case you have a free win).\n\n- If you are even: Take your pick of strategy. You can go for Mutalisks, Infestor/Zergling, or Roach/Hydralisk/Infestor.\n\n- If you are behind: You can attempt a Baneling all-in and hope your opponent over produced Drones. However, this is a situation that relies on luck for success. Going for a Roach/Baneling all in generally will not work - even if your opponent goes for Mutalisks, they will have enough of an early lead to build defense and get their Mutalisks out. We suggest going for fast Infestors with burrow. If your opponent takes a fast third you can hope for some lucky burrowed Infestor harass while at the same time have an efficient defense with well placed Fungal Growths.", "question": "If you are ahead in a Zerg vs. Zerg match, what strategy is recommended to start a snowball effect?", "options": ["Going for fast Infestors with burrow", "Taking a Roach/Baneling all-in", "Moving into two base Mutalisks", "Focusing on a third base expansion"], "answer": "Moving into two base Mutalisks"}

The Marines, produced with a Reactor, provide the firepower and Marauders are there to counter Stalkers. This gives Terran map control until Warpgate finishes, at which point the Protoss will have too many units to be fought head-on without either Bunkers or Stimpack finished.\n\nThis build is designed to counter very fast expansion Protoss builds and is fairly simple to pull off, despite not being seen often at the highest levels of play.\n\n## Goal\n\nProduce Marines for enough firepower to pressure your opponent. Support with Marauders if opposing units are armored or with Reapers if light.

The goal is to catch them just before they morph.  Other notes:\n\n- It's best to transfer a few Drones to the natural when it is completed, so it looks like you are saturating the base.  If your opponents sees no Drones at the natural, they may suspect an all-in.\n\n- Send the Queen and a pair of Zerglings to the natural as well to deny scouting.\n\n- Rally Zerglings into a corner of the main, so the attack remains hidden.\n\n- Speed should finish at 5:35.\n\n### Scouting\n\nThe timings of the hatch at 14 supply may seem odd, but it ensures that the hatch goes down at the same time as a 16 Hatch, had you gone 14 Pool, 16 Hatch.  This maintains an aura of secrecy.\n\nYou must deny scouting at all costs.  If your opponent suspects the build, they only have to make a few Banelings/Zerglings to counter it.\n\n## Execution\n\nExecution is straightforward, rally Zerglings into your opponents natural/main and kill everything.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nThere is no transition from this cheese.  The only exception might be if your opponent opens on one base.  In that case, make Drones and mine gas.  Continue as if you weren't going to all-in, scout/harass with Zerglings.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\nShort rush distances are best for this build.  Maps like Ohana, Ulrena, and Cloud Kingdom provide the perfect terrain.  Will work on four player maps if you scout your opponent early.\n\n### Con features\n\nLong rush distances.  For example, Daybreak's rocks in the middle of the map will delay the push to unacceptable limits.  If you suspect your opponent is greedy then the rush will work, but not recommended for ladder play.", "question": "In the Ling Flood strategy, what upgrade is crucial to finish before moving out with the Zerglings?", "options": ["Burrow", "Metabolic Boost", "Pneumatized Carapace", "Adrenal Glands"], "answer": "Metabolic Boost"}

Having enough Detectors across the map is an important aspect of any player's strategy, as they will provide intel on potentially fatal attacks from otherwise unstoppable hidden units. While every race has a mobile detector unit, they also have a passive defense building that provides detection, such as Photon Cannons, Spore Crawlers, and Missile Turrets. Detector buildings lack the mobility of units, but make up for it by being much more durable and by being equipped with a weapon. Regardless of which race a player uses, if the opponent uses cloaked or burrowed units, having a Detector in your army before engaging your opponent is pivotal.\n\n## Detector Units\n\nUnits in Starcraft II are tagged with one or more Attributes that determine bonus damage, affect targeting, and/or can influence spells and abilities.\n\nThe Detector units, categorized by race, are listed below.\n\n### Protoss\n\n- Observer (range 11 (+2.75))\n\n- Oracle ability Revelation (range 9, radius 6, duration 20 s)\n\n- Photon Cannon (range 11)\n\n### Terran\n\n- Raven (range 11)\n\n- Ghost's EMP Round reveals cloaked, but not burrowed units.

{"document": "# 4\n## Openings\n### CC Rax Gas\n\nIf all is normal, your two Marines will be enough to deter his handful of (usually two to four) early Zerglings and your Hellions will be quickly out on the map. Your first two Hellions should be used to clear out any Zerglings near your base and to check for a third base on the Zerg's end. Spotting of the third base is a key scouting consideration and should be something that you never skip. If you see a third base, you can do some mild harass of his Creep spread, or if he has too many Drones at his third, roast some Drones. Do not let these Hellions die. Much as in the Reaper FE opening, these Hellions are the backbone of what allow you to expand to a third base and progress into the mid game (or in the case of a two base push style, they are critical splash damage needed in your push). When you have four Hellions, it is acceptable to do a small raid. This aggression is at your own risk. As long as he has made enough Zerglings so that he could kill this group of Hellions, they have no need to really go onto Creep at all; in fact, going onto Creep if there any chance at all to lose your Hellions is an error and you will lose many games if you do this. The only semi-reliable prompts for doing a raid with six Hellions include seeing either way too many Drones at his third base or a six Queen opening (as this means the Zerg will have a late Zergling speed upgrade). Once you have six Hellions, you will either be sending your third Command Center to take a third base or getting ready to hit some kind of Stim timing attack off of two bases. Either way, work your way home and keep the Hellions alive. Some players will opt to go for eight to ten Hellions instead of the normal six. This type of play is especially strong against a Zerg going for an aggressive Zergling or Zergling/Baneling play and, conversely, weak against any type of Roach play.\n\nIf at any point in the opening you spot Roaches, cut Hellion/Marine production to focus on Mines/Marauders. One choice you can make is to add one Marauder before Stim against a Zerg that went for gas. This gives you a lot more firepower against Roaches that show up uninvited. Adding one to two extra Bunkers over the normal one that you will be adding as you move into the mid game is crucial when facing Roaching players. If the Zerg goes for aggression of the Speedling or Baneling variety, do not stop making Hellions. Mines are simply not the answer to such play and you will need the splash damage of the Hellions in order to deal with the swarmy nature of such plays. If a Zerg player has opened with Hatch-gas-pool, you will want the wall at your natural to be complete before six minutes (5:55 to be exact). Keep in mind that scouting such plays before they hit is the most important part of defending them. Any aggression that does not include Banelings should prompt you to pull SCVs before he arrives in order to land a strong repair on your defensive structures. Consider emergency placement of wall off buildings and Bunkers (most Terrans seem to favor a total of three Bunkers when facing early one or two-base aggression). The most key part of defending aggression is positioning of all the critical units. You do not want to lose Bunkers or Hellions because SCVs were not pre-pulled or Hellions were out on the map and have to fight their way home.", "question": "In the CC Rax Gas opening, what is the recommended action if you spot Roaches from the Zerg player?", "options": ["Continue making Hellions and Marines", "Add one Marauder before Stim and focus on Mines/Marauders", "Build additional Bunkers only", "Send your third Command Center to take a third base"], "answer": "Add one Marauder before Stim and focus on Mines/Marauders"}

{"document": "# Kiting\n## How To\n### General Tips\n\nThe most important thing to practice when it comes to kiting is the timing. You usually do not want to waste an opportunity to fire. In order to deal out the maximum amount of damage in a given time while moving with your units, you're going to want to attack just as the cooldown for the units attack is up. Different units have different cooldowns of course, but most ranged units have roughly similar periods.\n\nNote that kiting is not just for retreating, but for pursuit, or even a transitional tool to get your units into a better place during a battle.\nPursuing an enemy force with the kiting technique ensures that no time is wasted by the enemy getting out of range during your units cooldown period. By that I mean, for example, that as the Zealots retreat, they escape your units range just before another attack is about to come. Since the Zealots were in range for most of the time, your units had no inclination to follow, and the gap between you and your enemy gets bigger for nothing.\n\nMoving a large force up a ramp is another great example of when kiting serves great purpose. Without kiting, you would have to march your entire army up the ramp before you could engage, or parts of your army would be blocked by your own units as you engage. Marching an entire army can take several seconds, which can prove to be valuable time lost during an encounter. With the kiting method, the front part of your army will already be attacking while moving, greatly reducing the head start your enemy no doubt gets from being in place already.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the primary purpose of kiting during a battle?", "options": ["To waste time while retreating", "To maximize damage output while moving", "To prevent your units from attacking", "To increase the cooldown period of your units"], "answer": "To maximize damage output while moving"}

It requires a Lair to build and can create Nydus Worms. A Nydus Worm can be built anywhere one has vision, without need for Creep or a Drone. The worm takes 14 seconds to set up before emerging from the ground and settling into position. During this set up phase it has 3 armor. Once in position, it acts as the exit to the Nydus Network, allowing the player to transfer units from the network to the worm almost instantly. Once the worm is finished moving it cannot be re-moved and will act as a building. You cannot (simultaneously) build multiple Nydus Worms from a single network, but you can build another Nydus Worm after the first worm is done spawning. All worms and networks are connected to each other. Units in the Nydus Network will die only if all worms and networks on the map are destroyed.\n\n## Abilities\n\nLoad\nThe Nydus Worms and Nydus Networks can load a maximum of 255 ground units into a shared underground network.\n\n## Other\n\n- Nydus Worms act as both entrances and exits; units can safely retreat back into the Nydus they came from and will take no harm should the Nydus Worm get destroyed \"behind\" them, nor will the Nydus Network unlike its predecessor in SC:BW. However, if there are units that remain in the Nydus Network when all canals and Network are destroyed, the units are lost.\n\n- The maximum number of units that a Nydus Network can hold is 255, and the maximum cargo space that a Nydus Worm has is 1020 - which is, considering the maximum amount of supply is 200, an unlimited capacity (at least for 1v1).\n\n- Units take .25s to enter the Nydus Worm and .5s to exit it. This can be done with a rally point.\n\n- Drones can be rallied directly onto mineral patches and - with the help of the Shift key - back to the Nydus. The same can be done on the other side to a Hatchery. Alas, the unloading has to be ordered manually for each instance.\n\n- Spine Crawlers and Spore Crawlers are considered buildings and cannot be transferred.\n\n- Non permanent units such as those under control of Neural Parasite, Changelings, and Infested Terrans cannot enter the Nydus Network.", "question": "Which of the following units cannot be transferred through the Nydus Network?", "options": ["Zerglings", "Spine Crawlers", "Hydralisks", "Roaches"], "answer": "Spine Crawlers"}

The build is designed to strike the opponent before his or her army has a sizable number of units with splash damage abilities (for instance, High Templar with Psionic Storm or Colossus).  This attack can be used against openings that skip an early army in favor of fast Teching and early economic growth.  Examples include Forge Fast Expand builds that are combined with Stargate openings.\n\n### Goal\n\nHydralisks are slow off Creep, making them bad offensively without good creep spread.  This creep spread can take a considerable amount of time; Nydus Worms are an expensive, but effective, way of skipping this step in getting to the opponent's base.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\nAny opening other than Speedling Expand will work for this build.  The reason why you cannot use the Speedling Expand opening is because you must delay Metabolic Boost until after getting Lair (or until after expanding on larger maps).  In general, you should scout for Gateway openings from the Protoss, as this may mean a 3-Gate Sentry Expand build that will quickly turn into Protoss pressure once a critical mass of Sentries is reached.\n\n| 2 Base Nydus (Hydralisk Version) |\n| --- |\n| @ 100 , Lair + Extractor (2)[1]; @ 100 , Metabolic Boost + Extractor (3) + Evolution Chamber; @ 100% Lair, Hydralisk Den; @ 200 , Nydus Network; @ 100% Hydralisk Den, Grooved Spines + Missile Attack Level 1; @ 100% Nydus Network, Overseer[2] |\n| ↑ Do not delay Lair if the opposing player opens with a Forge Fast Expand build, as Protoss players tend to go from either Stargate or Gateway pressure straight into Colossus, making the timing for a Hydralisk attack limited.; ; ↑ Skip making an Overseer if multiple Overlords are already in position to lay down a Nydus Worm. |\n\n- @ 100 , Lair + Extractor (2)[1]\n\n- @ 100 , Metabolic Boost + Extractor (3) + Evolution Chamber\n\n- @ 100% Lair, Hydralisk Den\n\n- @ 200 , Nydus Network\n\n- @ 100% Hydralisk Den, Grooved Spines + Missile Attack Level 1\n\n- @ 100% Nydus Network, Overseer[2]\n\n- ↑ Do not delay Lair if the opposing player opens with a Forge Fast Expand build, as Protoss players tend to go from either Stargate or Gateway pressure straight into Colossus, making the timing for a Hydralisk attack limited.\n\n- ↑ Skip making an Overseer if multiple Overlords are already in position to lay down a Nydus Worm.\n\n## Execution\n\nOnce your Missile Attack Level 1 and Grooved Spines upgrades are started, immediately start the Nydus Network and start searching for an opponent's blind spot.\n\n- Bring one Queen to lay a Creep Tumor to spread in the base.\n\n- Try to attack while the Protoss army is on the low ground.\n\n## Maps\n\n- The size of the main base and the rush distance between your base and your opponent's (the longer, the better) are the only important factors to consider for this build.\n\n- If there is a short ground distance between your base and the opponent's, pressure from the Protoss is more likely, making the late timing of this build a hazard.", "question": "Why is the Speedling Expand opening not suitable for the two base Nydus Worm timing attack strategy in ZvP?", "options": ["It requires too much creep spread.", "It focuses on defensive structures.", "It delays the Metabolic Boost upgrade until after getting Lair.", "It prioritizes economic growth over unit production."], "answer": "It delays the Metabolic Boost upgrade until after getting Lair."}
{"document": "# Infestor (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nNeural Parasite should be used on any high damage or high cost units such as Battlecruisers, Siege Tanks and Thors. Since Siege Tanks greatly outrange this ability, Roaches or Zerglings, are often used to draw fire to allow the Infestor to get in range to use Neural Parasite. It is used against Battlecruisers to force them to teleport away from a fight, or to teleport them in place so they cannot escape.\n\nFungal Growth brutalizes Terran Bio armies. Bio units tend to fight in tight clumps, maximizing the number of units affected. Two consecutive Fungal Growths will kill Marines. Furthermore, Bio units often use stutter step micro to exploit their mobility in combat; Fungal Growth mitigates this advantage, allowing Zerglings to surround, Banelings to connect, and for Hydralisks to attack the marines with their superior range. It can also immobilize and kill Medivacs to block Terran drop harass. In the late game it is often used to protect Brood Lords from Marines and Vikings.  However, the spell has seen a drop in use since its change to a projectile spell.\n\nMicrobial Shroud is extremely rare in this matchup. Terran doesn't tend to go full air, and even if they do, they still come with ground mech support like Siege Tanks or Ghosts which the shroud doesn't do anything to it.

{"document": "# Carrier (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n### Attack Mechanics\n\nWhen attacking, Carriers launch their available Interceptors towards the target, at a delay of 0.5 seconds per Interceptor; a full complement of Interceptors thus takes 4 seconds to all launch from the Carrier.\n\nWithout the ability Release Interceptors the Carrier's launch range is 8, meaning that an enemy target must be within range 8 before the Carrier will launch Interceptors at it. But after launching Interceptors, the Carrier can move back to a leash range of 12 before the Interceptors disengage and return to the Carrier. Interceptors will also return to the Carrier once the current target has been destroyed if the Carrier is not within launch range of any enemy targets. If the Carrier is attacking a target, moves out of launch range, and there is a closer target with the same priority in launch range, the Interceptors will switch their target to the closer one.\n\nNote that manually assigning a target will cause the Carrier to move towards the new target if it is outside of launch range. However, if Interceptors have already been launched and are not already disengaging, it is possible to change targets and then take advantage of the leash range by immediately moving the Carrier back; the launched Interceptors will migrate to the new target without returning to the Carrier despite it being out of launch range, though they will switch targets as noted above if they perceive a closer threat in launch range unless they are continuously manually assigned the farther target. Any unlaunched or newly created Interceptors will not launch at a target outside of launch range, though, so Interceptor losses suffered will not be able to be replaced at leash range.\n\nA Carrier's effective attack power is the attack of one Interceptor times the number of active Interceptors the Carrier has launched. Each Air Weapons upgrade level researched affects each Interceptor individually, so Carriers gain a large increase in effective attack power for each upgrade. Similarly, each point of armor on the target results in a large decrease in effective damage dealt, as the damage is reduced for each Interceptor's attack.", "question": "When a Carrier's Interceptors are launched, what is the maximum distance (leash range) the Carrier can move away from the target before the Interceptors disengage and return to the Carrier?", "options": ["8", "10", "12", "15"], "answer": "12"}

In a pinch, you can block off your ramp and transfer workers to another base using this.\n\n- Roaches: While Roaches are more expensive in terms of resources, supply, and Larvae, they are also more mobile and can deal with Hellion drops more easily.

{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Execution\n### Adaptations\n#### 2 Hatch Economic Muta into Sling/Bling/Muta\n\n2 Hatch Economic Muta is very similar to that of BW, except with superior production capabilities. Essentially, Zerg tries to spend as little money as possible on ground forces while building up a strong muta force to harass as well as building up a solid economy. It is key to scan or have a floating rax arrive at around 9 minutes to check for Spire to determine Mutalisk timing.\n\nAfter you secure 2 gases, make a total of at least 6 Raxes and 2 Engineering Bays.\n\nDealing with early-game muta harass in TvZ is different from BW. A key difference is that medics are now Medivacs (a relatively high-tech unit). Although you will still have access to early stim, you cannot deal with muta harass by repeatedly stimming your Marines in the center of the map, you need to commit to a push. Transitioning via 4OC means that you will not have Medivacs until ~13 minutes.\n\nRegardless of your play-style, it is highly recommended that you:\n\n- Sim-city with at least 6 turrets (3 per external geyser). If you have 4 gas geysers, two are \"internal\", 2 are \"external\", you want to build turrets on the same line as external geysers. Additional turrets should be placed near the exposed cliff. You want turrets to be up before Mutalisks arrive.\n\n- As the game goes on, do not be conservative on your turrets. In fact, VODs of BW's Flash are a great resource to learn proper turret placement.\n\nWhen transitioning to mid-game for a 15-16 minute pre-Brood Lord timing attack:\n\n- Actively deny creep between 10–15 minutes to the best of your ability; you want to keep creep contained to (at most) half the map.\n\n- Tech to Marines/Tanks/Thors (1 Thor for every 6 mutas), +Ravens/Medivacs.\n\n- If Zerg insists on non-stop muta harass, it is always a good investment to get the +2 Building Armor upgrade. +2 armor on clumped buildings against mutas is really more like a +5 armor due to glaive mechanics. Furthermore, it will greatly help your expansion's Planetary Fortress by bolstering it to 5 armor.\n\nIf you have good bio-ball control:\n\nAnother advanced method of dealing with 2 Hatch muta is to research fast stim and combat shields and move out with a medium sized group of Marines at around 10 minutes so you can apply non-stop pressure, while slowly teching to tanks. If Zerg chooses to continue harassing your base, you can just go and kill the Zerg's natural as your opponent will likely have very few Banelings to defend. However, this method is not as reliable when compared to the BW equivalent because lack of medics means you will not be able to repeatedly stim. 4OC can help you easily sustain a continuous stream of Marines.\n\nThe above method is actually preferred as Zerg often become too confident in their Muta harass, taking their fast 3rd and (sometimes) 4th bases before the 14 minute mark.", "question": "What is a recommended strategy for dealing with early-game muta harass in TvZ?", "options": ["Build at least 6 turrets, 3 per external geyser, and place additional turrets near the exposed cliff.", "Transition to a 4OC build and focus on producing a large number of medics.", "Ignore the muta harass and focus on expanding your economy.", "Tech to air units immediately to counter the mutalisks."], "answer": "Build at least 6 turrets, 3 per external geyser, and place additional turrets near the exposed cliff."}

Part of her Covert Ops theme is having all the right toys at the right time. Nova has different equipment sets and can adapt to any situation by swapping between them on the field. She can use her Tactical Stealth Suit and Sabotage Drone, infiltrate the enemy base ahead of her army and take out critical units and base defenses before her army commits to an engagement. She can then decide to go loud and go toe-to-toe using her Hellfire Shotgun and damage-absorbing Phase Reactor Suit. The Hellfire Shotgun deals massive area damage and can clear weaker enemies in one shot.\n\nNova has very powerful base and production mechanics. She has a maximum army limit of 100 supply but she does not need Supply Depots. Her production structures call down units to the battlefield instantly without any training time.

{"document": "# Stalker (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Immortal Archon Chargelot army composition has become the most prominent in the matchup since the release of Legacy of the Void, due to the massive nerfs to the Colossus as well as the addition of the Lurker. These changes have made using large masses of Stalkers obsolete in favor of the beefier IAC composition. That said, when dealing with roaches, Overlord scouts, or air based tech switches they are competent all-rounders but outclassed by specialist units from the Robotics Facility and Stargate (against roaches and zerg air, respectively). Immortals in particular are far more cost efficient against enemy armored ground composition.\n\nWith respect to air, the speed boost from Blink is useful at chasing down small flocks of Mutalisks, however a large amount of Mutas can be very difficult to defend against without the help of Phoenix or Psionic Storm. Lategame a way to use Stalkers is as anti Broodlord units. One has to be careful of Lurkers on the ground nonetheless as blinking under Broodlords over Lurkers will result in losing the Stalkers for little to no gain.\n\nIn recent years Blink + Robo bay based builds have risen to prominence again as a timing oriented style that aims to hit the Zerg with an attack before more enough Lurkers or more advanced Hive tech units are out. This is opposite of the Chargelot Immortal Archon style which usually aims to scale into the late game. This comp is very effective against ling bane centric comps as the Colossus murders the ling bane, the Stalkers can soak up quite a decent chunk of banes and good forcefields can make it difficult or even impossible for the Zerg to get a surround on your army.", "question": "In StarCraft II, which unit is particularly effective against enemy armored ground units, making it more cost efficient compared to large masses of Stalkers?", "options": ["Stalker", "Colossus", "Immortal", "Archon"], "answer": "Immortal"}

Moving out of range will abort the spell.\n\nThe spell specifically deals 25 damage every .24 seconds on intiation for 20 hits and stuns at the initiation of damage.\n\n## Use\n\nSince the Thor is totally helpless while channeling and deals the same amount of damage without the spell, it is very rarely used or researched. In most scenarios units can even maneuver out of range before it is operative. The spell damage quickly destroys Immortals, however, and the stun can have limited utility.\n\nIt can nonetheless be used in Zerg and Terran matchups to quickly destroy bases while disabling them. Three Thors (e.g. dropped by Medivacs) can take down a Hatchery or Command Center within 10 seconds. Four Thors are required to destroy a Nexus or Lair.\n\nThe 250mm Strike Cannons can one-shot-kill the following units and structures:\n\n- Pylon\n\n- Photon Cannon\n\n- Colossus\n\n- Immortal\n\n- Archon\n\n- Supply Depot\n\n- Bunker\n\n- Missile Turret\n\n- Refinery\n\n- Spine Crawler\n\n- Spore Crawler\n\n- Ultralisk left with 1 HP\n\n- Extractor left with 1 HP\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\n250mm Strike Cannons are a good way of killing Immortals. Since the damage received is considered Spell damage (like Yamato Cannon), neither armor values nor the Immortal's Hardened Shield apply, and the Strike Cannons will kill an Immortal.\n250mm Strike Cannons are also useful when dropship harassing with a single Thor, as they can kill a Pylon very quickly. This may be used to render a crucial building unpowered, though with one vehicle weapons upgrade and target fire this ability is irrelevant, and should be used only to avoid Feedback damage if High Templars are in play.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nWhen two Thors attack each other one on one, the Thor that gets the first shot off will win. However, the 250mm Strike Cannons can stun for six seconds while dealing 500 damage.\n\nThors are part of some successful late game compositions. They excel against Vikings, if they are clumped, as well as on the ground. However, they lose handily to Battlecruisers, making them only a compositional boon, and not a staple or necessity in late game play, especially given their high supply cost.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nSince 250mm Strike Cannons should only be used on \"bigger\" targets, they are limited to taking out Ultralisks and buildings. However, as of patch 16, Ultralisks are natively immune to the stunning part of this spell. Although this does not exempt them from taking the armor-ignoring spell damage, they can be moved out of the 7+4 range in order to dodge the full barrage and abort the Thor's channeling.\n\n## Other\n\n- Can be used against buildings.\n\n- Can be used against neutral units/structures such as Destructible Rocks.\n\n- A stunned target is unable to move, attack or use abilities. This includes using transports, (defensive) buildings and any research or production taking place in them.\n\n- The range of 7 is equal to the Thor's ground attack range.\n\n## Notes\n\nSince the DPS of the 250mm Strike Cannon is 50 (500 damage over 10 seconds), getting a Level 1 Vehicle upgrade will enable the Thor to have a greater Ground DPS than the Cannons (46.9 + 4.7)", "question": "What is the primary effect of the 250mm Strike Cannons spell when it successfully targets a unit?", "options": ["It heals the targeted unit", "It stuns the targeted unit for 10 seconds", "It increases the speed of the targeted unit", "It grants vision to the targeted area"], "answer": "It stuns the targeted unit for 10 seconds"}

(The other two are the Nexus and the Pylon.)\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\nThe most efficient way to harvest Vespene from an Assimilator is to assign exactly three Probes to it. A worker count text is displayed over the Assimilator. It turns red when the worker count is higher than three.\n\nThe timing of when to build Assimilators and transfer Probes from mineral gathering to Vespene is an important strategic consideration. Many Build Orders will specify when to build the first or second Assimilator, and the player must also carefully balance mineral and gas needs during mid-game transitions.\n\nLike its Terran and Zerg counterparts, players will sometimes build Assimilators on the Vespene Geysers in their opponents' base, usually in the early stages of a match. This maneuver, called a \"Gas Steal,\" provides several competitive benefits including a delay in the opponent's ability to gather Vespene. The Probe's ability to begin warping in an Assimilator and then immediately continue scouting makes the gas steal somewhat easier for Protoss players.", "question": "What is the most efficient number of Probes to assign to an Assimilator for Vespene Gas collection in StarCraft II?", "options": ["2", "3", "4", "5"], "answer": "3"}

You need speed for Zerglings to cross larger maps to hit the timing and execute the Baneling bust correctly.*\n\n### Scouting\n\n- There are few strategies that hit early enough to warrant paying attention to gas or other timings of the Terran. This is also a strategy that starts with an early Pool and can therefore not be done after scouting the opponent's opener.\n\n- You'll want to fly Overlords to possible spawning spots like on other maps. If you scout the Terran attempt to hide the Overlord before the Terran spots your scout. The Terran can guess your position and help determine which way to send a scout. The strategy is stronger if the Terran does not see the suspicious one base play before it is too late.\n\n## Execution\n\n### Adaptation\n\n## Execution\n\n- Aim for the weakest point in the wall-off, but Bunkers and not Supply Depots and Add-Ons should not be targeted unless there is no other choice.\n\n- Both Marines and SCVs takes 3 shots to kill.\n\n- Avoid getting your Roaches surrounded by the SCVs. Kite for as long as possible to do maximum damage versus the workers.\n\n- If you cannot avoid getting surrounded by the workers, hug the wall to minimize surface area. This limits the damage taken by the Roaches from SCVs as those can do quite a lot of damage.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\nThe Roach rush is strong on maps like Entombed Valley, Antiga Shipyard or Tal'darim Altar where there is not always fixed spots. It is stronger on smaller maps as the rush distance is shorter.\n\nThis prevents the Terran from scouting you first 100% of the time to spot the incoming Roach rush.\n\n- Entombed Valley\n\n- Tal'Darim Altar LE\n\n- Antiga Shipyard\n\n### Con features\n\nLong rush distance, fixed spots, scouting pattern and Xel'Naga towers make this a hard map to Roach rush out without being spotted relatively early by a Terran who sends out a reasonable SCV scout.\n\n- Daybreak", "question": "In the 7 Roach Rush into Baneling Bust strategy, what is the primary purpose of transitioning into Banelings after the initial Roach attack?", "options": ["To defend against incoming Terran air units", "To punish a greedy Terran who goes Command Center first by busting their wall", "To scout the Terran's base for further attacks", "To provide additional health regeneration for Roaches"], "answer": "To punish a greedy Terran who goes Command Center first by busting their wall"}

{"document": "# Immortal (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe use of early Immortals depends on the Zerg's strategy. They are less effective against Hydralisks and Zerglings and are unable to attack Mutalisks, and thus have little use against Zerg armies that largely consist of these units. Conversely, Immortals are strongly cost-effective against Roaches due to their 50 base damage against armored units and +2 range advantage over Roaches. Do note that just because Immortals counter Roaches does not mean that it's black and white, as their economic costs and production system are very different. GAMETIME a 6k MMR Zerg player has been known to take wins against Protoss players with mass Roach timings, meaning when they hit early enough, Immortals alone aren't enough.  Sentries are excellent additions when defending these timings as forcefields can deny Roaches the ability to walk up to the Immortal and attack.\n\nTowards the midgame, Immortals are not a unit a Protoss player should avoid. Even if the opponent starts without any Roaches or Lurkers, producing Immortals preemptively denies the transition for the Zerg player due to their bonus against armor, which is particuarly important in protecting the Protoss from a Lurker switch. For example, Hydralisk-based armies tend to transition into Lurkers making the Immortal necessary.

The Mutalisk is a fast flying unit, which means it has certain options when it comes to kiting that regular ground units can not do. For instance, it can kite approaching enemies to the edge of a cliff, where the opponent can not follow, thus halting any attack against the Mutalisk. It is also impervious to any sort of terrain, and can kite in any direction it wants to, without fear of being blocked or cornered. However, since the Mutalisk has less range than any unit that can hit it, except the Archon, it's kiting is not very effective, since anytime it can attack, so can the target.\n\n- Hydralisk. The Hydralisk might not be the fastest unit on normal ground, but the range upgrade available at the Hydralisk Den increases its range from 5 to 6, which outranges most other ground units in the game.

Kiting your Roaches well is very important early game against Zealots. Unmicroed you risk getting overrun by a 2-gate, while kiting can kill a lot of Zealots without losing any Roaches at all. In low number (say less than 5 of both) it can be very effective to use just one Roach to kite (don't bother attacking) all the Zealots while the others stand still and shoot.

The Planetary Fortress is a defense-oriented upgrade that has three aspects: more armour, a splash attack, and more SCV garrison space; the upgrade does not actually increase health. It has none of the Orbital Command abilities and cannot lift off. The Planetary Fortress is commonly used on distant expansions to prevent against harassment from units such as Hellions, Zealots or Zerglings.\n\nCompared to the usage of Orbitals, the requirement for an Engineering Bay and the extra gas cost means they are not typically used at expansions until the late game. However, the Planetary Fortress Rush has also been employed in some cheese strategies[1], such as in DiggitySCs' wildly famous 1000th commentary video [2]. TheLittleOne often used Planetary Fortresses as static defenses towards the end of his games when he was high on resources. This was before he switched to Zerg in October of 2010.\n\nThe Planetary Fortress has three splash radius. From the target, units until a distance of .5 are dealt 40 damage, units at a distance of .5 to .8 are dealt 30 damage, and units at a distance of .8 to 1.25 are dealt 15 damage. Unlike Siege Tanks, splash damage from a Planetary Fortress does not harm friendly units. Thus, it is not possible for an enemy to kill SCVs simply by parking a unit in the mineral line of a Planetary Fortress.\n\nThe Planetary Fortress is affected by the Hi-Sec Auto Tracking upgrade. Hi-Sec Auto Tracking increases the range of Missile Turrets, Auto-Turrets and the Planetary Fortress by +1. If targeted by Blinding Cloud, the Planetary Fortress will have its range reduced to 1.\n\n| Unit | Minerals: | Vespene Gas: | Supply: | Build Time: | Key |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| SCV | 50 | 0 | 1 | 12 | S |\n\n## Abilities\n\nLoad\nRange: 6\nEnables the Terran player to load SCV's into a Command Center or Planetary Fortress.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nHi-Sec Auto Tracking Minerals: 100 Vespene Gas: 100 Build Time: 57\nResearched from: Engineering Bay\nAdds +1 attack range to Auto-Turrets, Missile Turrets, and Planetary Fortresses.\n\nNeosteel Armor Minerals: 150 Vespene Gas: 150 Build Time: 100\nResearched from: Engineering Bay\nIncreases the armor of all Terran structures by 2.

{"document": "# 4 Warpgate Rush\n## Overview\n\nThe 4 Warpgate Rush, often referred to colloquially as the \"4 Gate\", is an aggressive opening most commonly used in PvP. It has also been used in PvZ and PvT, but it is much less common in those match-ups. Due to the way that the Warpgate mechanic works, this build will allow you to produce a large burst of units in or around your opponent's base very early in the game, which will give you a good chance of killing the opponent if they weren't prepared for the rush. The build is an all-in as you cannot transition out of it without dealing very heavy damage to the economy of the opponent. The reason for this is that constant unit production from four Warpgates allows no resources for either an expansion or additional tech.\n\nThe popularity of this build during the early stages of Wings of Liberty, coupled with changes to the game that actively made the strategy weaker, led to a multitude of openings specially designed to deflect this rush. However, given that this build is no longer used as commonly as it once was, most modern PvP openings don't actively take the 4 Gate into account. This means that a 4 Gate can still be used successfully against an unprepared opponent who fails to scout that it is coming.\n\nThe 4 Gate relies heavily on the use of proxy Pylons to produce reinforcements as close to the opponent's base as possible. The proxy Pylon is the key to the attack and if you are unable to place a proxy Pylon then it is highly likely that your rush will be deflected with ease. For this reason, many counter strategies focus heavily on denying the placement of a useful proxy Pylon, and it can often be a good idea for lower-level players to send more than one Probe to build proxy Pylons.", "question": "What is the key element in the 4 Warpgate Rush that allows for reinforcement production close to the opponent's base?", "options": ["Overlord", "Proxy Pylons", "Reaper", "Zealot"], "answer": "Proxy Pylons"}

{"document": "# Auto-Turret (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### In General\n\nAuto-Turrets see limited usage in competitive StarCraft. This is primarily because the Raven's other spells see more attention in competitive play, leaving the Auto-Turret as an energy dump after Seeker Missiles and Point Defense Drones have been cast.  Despite this, Auto-Turrets retain specific uses in all match ups.\n\n- Harassment: One such use is the harassment of undefended expansions.  A smaller number of turrets can halt mining at an expansion until the defending player can bring units to protect his economy. Should the opponent engage the turret with workers, a Seeker Missile can be devastating.  If used in conjunction with an offensive push or other harassment, Auto-Turrets are capable of dealing enough damage to severely cripple or fully destroy the expansion.  An upgraded AT could singlehandedly destroy a Hatchery/Lair/Hive, Command Center/Orbital Command (without armor upgrade) or Nexus (at +1 shield armor upgrade or less).\n\n- Defense: Auto-Turrets are used defensively to absorb damage by opposing armies, acting as an HP-buffer and/or hindering the movement of melee units like Zealots and Ultralisks, while soaking up damage from ranged attackers.\n\n- Vision: While normally delegated to Ravens or Scanner Sweeps Auto-Turrets can provide vision in dangerous areas, either ahead of an army, or on high ground.

It has some abilities which the Overlord does not have: the ability to Detect invisible units, spawn Changelings and Contaminate. The Overseer is extremely useful for scouting and detecting enemy units/positions. It moves faster than the Overlord and also receives the benefit of the Pneumatized Carapace upgrade. In return, it loses the Overlord's ability to transport units and Generate Creep.\n\nIt is a generally a good idea to include Overseers in a mid-end game army to detect any stealth units.\n\n## Abilities\n\nOversight\nCaster: Overseer\nDuration: 0.54 s\nGrants the Overseer 25% wider vision, but removes its ability to move.

They provide invaluable scouting information with their high movement speed, long sight range, and ability to drop Changelings. As the Zerg's only mobile detection, they are necessary to defend against cloaked/burrowed units from all three races. Often, if an opponent is suspected of having the ability to produce cloaked units, an Overseer is morphed preemptively upon morphing a Lair.\n\nA common tactic to get a scout into your opponent's base is to move an Overseer to the cliff, and drop a Changeling there. The speed of the Overseer allows it to easily escape, and the Changeling will give you at least some information before it is killed. However, Changelings should be dropped strategically, so the other player will not notice the unit for the split-second that it is your color.\n\nContaminate can be used to deny any enemies ability to tech, raise an army, or even produce workers. A contaminated Hatchery will not spawn larvae from the periodic (10.71)  larva or Spawn Larvae.\n\n## External links\n\n- Day9 Daily Funday Monday #260 featuring extensive use of Contamination", "question": "Which ability of the Overseer allows it to see cloaked, burrowed, and hallucinated units?", "options": ["Oversight", "Spawn Changeling", "Contaminate", "Detector"], "answer": "Detector"}

{"document": "# Repair\n\nRepair\nAbility Information\nCaster(s):SCVMULECost: Minerals: 0  Vespene Gas: 0\nRange:0.1\nResearched from:No research needed\n\n## Cost and Duration\n\nThe cost and duration of each repair is calculable. To repair a unit from 1 health to maximum health costs 25% of the total unit cost. For example, fully repairing a unit which is 200 minerals and 200 gas will cost 50 minerals and 50 gas. The time needed to repair a unit is dependent on its build time. A unit which takes 60 seconds to create will also take 60 seconds to repair with a single SCV. These values are proportional. If a unit is half damaged and it takes 60 seconds, 200 minerals, and 200 gas to create, it will cost 30 seconds, 25 minerals, and 25 gas to repair.\n\nBuildings are the same, however due to Terran buildings catching fire and receiving damage below 33% life, that extra damage must also be repaired thus giving the effect of an extra cost. Buildings which are under construction cannot be repaired until construction is finished.\n\nThe Command Center behaves differently from all other buildings because it can be changed into a Planetary Fortress or Orbital Command. After the building is upgraded, the cost and build time of the upgrade is added to the cost and build time of the Command Center to determine its repair duration and cost. So, if a Command Center takes 100 seconds to build and costs 400 minerals and a Planetary Fortress costs 150 minerals, 150 gas, and 60 seconds, then the total cost of the building is 550 minerals (400 + 150), 150 gas (0 + 150), and 160 seconds (100 + 60). Because of this, the Planetary Fortress will cost 138 minerals (550 / 4), 38 gas (150 / 4), and 160 seconds to fully repair.\n\nSome buildings are created without cost such as the Point Defense Drone or Auto-Turret. In this case, default values of 100 minerals and 60 game seconds are used.\n\nAdding an additional SCV does not change the final cost of the repair, but repair time is inversely proportional to the number of SCV's repairing.\n\nA MULE repairs at exactly the same rate and cost of an SCV.  A MULE can also be repaired, with its value approximated at 60 minerals and a build time of 17 seconds.\n\n## Auto Repair\n\nSCVs set to auto-repair (Alt + R) that are placed in a Medivac/Bunker will automatically repair any other mechanical units inside of the Medivac/Bunker. However, SCVs inside a Medivac/Bunker cannot repair the Medivac/Bunker itself while they are cargo. They must leave the Medivac/Bunker in order to repair it.\n\n## Targeting Priority\n\nWhen an SCV repairs a unit it gains the same AI targeting priority as the unit which it is repairing. This means a unit which attack-moves toward a unit which is being repaired the AI will target whichever unit is closer, the SCV or the unit being repaired. This statement also assumes that the unit was already being repaired by an SCV. If a unit is at full health and takes damage then an SCV starts repairing, the unit will not change targets until it is re-ordered to attack, such as a new attack-move order.\n\nFor players struggling to attack the repairing SCVs, such as with a Thor which is very large, a useful strategy is to simply move command your units past the unit being repaired such that the SCVs end up between the target and your units.\n\n## Other Races\n\nThe Repair ability can also be used on units from other races that have the Mechanical trait. Although this rules out all of Zerg's buildings and units, it does include the majority of Protoss units. However, Repair cannot be used on Protoss structures.\n\nThe list includes: Probe, Stalker, Sentry, Immortal, Colossus, Observer, Warp Prism, Phoenix, Oracle, Void Ray, Tempest, Carrier, Interceptor, Mothership Core and Mothership.\n\nNote that SCVs cannot repair shields. This ability works on hit points only.", "question": "When repairing a Terran building that is under construction, which of the following statements is true?", "options": ["The building can be repaired at any point during construction.", "The building can only be repaired once it has been fully constructed.", "The building can be repaired partially during construction.", "The building can only be repaired if it has caught fire during construction."], "answer": "The building can only be repaired once it has been fully constructed."}

However, players should always be mindful each scan effectively costs them minerals by denying them the ability to Calldown: MULEs. So it's important to use Scans at the right times, and use them effectively.  The scan can be used through the minimap by clicking on it.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nIf the player has any reason to suspect the opponent is teching to Dark Templars it's best to save enough energy for one or two scans while laying down an Engineering Bay. The player can also use Scan to kill off the opponent's Observer. Without an Observer, the opponent will have a more difficult time casting Feedback on Ghosts. The temporary advantage gained after killing an Observer can mark a good time to either push out or engage the opponent.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nIf the player suspects the enemy is teching to Banshees they should save up energy for Scans while making sure they have an engineering bay and preparing to build missile turrets. Besides helping to ward off Banshees, Scan is useful while defending against enemy Ghosts launching Nukes. Scan can also help keep tabs on the opponents largely immobile army, and keep the player aware of when the opponent is moving out. There are also situations where Siege Tanks will be made able to fire on enemy units within range but barely covered by fog of war if the fog is revealed with a Scanner Sweep.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nAround the midgame when a Zerg opponent has recently completed Lair Tech a Terran player often attempts to scout a Zerg opponent's tech choice through using Scanner Sweep. If successful this will give the player significant intel which can potentially save hundreds of minerals otherwise used on Missile Turrets in anticipation of a Mutalisk harass. It can also signal the player to adequately prepare for incoming Mutalisk harassment. In anticipation of this the Zerg opponent will often attempt to conceal his tech buildings by building them in remote locations or fake out the Terran player by building a tech building they don't plan on using in an easily scoutable location.\n\n## Other\n\n- The Scanner Sweep animation changed from a ring of bright blue lines changing their length rapidly (Beta Patch 8) to a dull orange circle with a radar line circling rapidly counter-clockwise.\n\n- Trump claimed that you should nearly always scan your opponent's base at 6:30 to see what build order they are using. This is especially important for players using a build (such as the 1/1/1) that requires intensive scouting. However, if one can scout with a rax or hellion, this will also suffice due to the opportunity cost.\n\n- Some players will use an SCV early on to build a hidden Barracks near the enemy, after which they lift off and scout the opponent's base. The Barracks will likely be killed while slowly flying over the enemy base, but a scan will be saved for later use, or alternatively the 50 energy saved on a scan can be used for to call down a MULE, which will gather approximately 300 minerals in its lifetime (double the cost of the Barracks, but actually only slightly cheaper when you account for SCV lost mining time).\n\n## Notes", "question": "In competitive play, what is a primary use of Scanner Sweep against a Zerg opponent during the midgame?", "options": ["To detect and counter Mutalisk harassment", "To reveal hidden expansions", "To scout for Ultralisks", "To disrupt Queen regeneration"], "answer": "To detect and counter Mutalisk harassment"}

{"document": "# Warp Gate (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Warp Gate is a unit producing structure for the Protoss, capable of warping in ground units. Warp Gates provide an ability unique to the Protoss: the rapid creation of units at any location on the map covered by the Psionic Matrix, so long as the location is not obscured by the fog of war. This allows for quick, on-demand deployment of troops at key strategic locations. Warp Gates are created by transforming a Gateway after Warp Gate Research has been completed at the Cybernetics Core. By default, this transformation is set to auto-cast.\n\nAll units created at the Gateway can also be warped in by a Warp Gate. If a Cybernetics Core is controlled by the player, Stalkers, Sentries and Adepts can be warped in from the Warp Gate. Once the player warps in a Templar Archives, High Templar become available, and after a Dark Shrine is acquired, the Dark Templar can be warped in. If none of these additional buildings are available, then the Warp Gate is only capable of producing the Zealot.\n\nAny unit created by the Warp Gate has a typical warp-in time of 11.4 seconds (16 seconds at Normal speed). The warp-in process can be sped up to only 3.6 seconds (5 seconds at Normal speed) if the unit is in the Psionic Matrix of a Pylon which is close to a Nexus or a Warp Gate (a Gateway has no effect). This acceleration can disappear/appear mid warp-in, if the condition cited before disappear/appear (for example, a Pylon is destroyed/warped in, or a Gateway becomes a Warp Gate, or a Warp Gate becomes a Gateway).\n\nAs the warp-in starts, the Warp Gate enters a variable cooldown period. During this cooldown, the Warp Gate cannot produce any units. The length of the cooldown varies, based on the type of unit warped in, as seen in the table below.  If the Psionic Matrix is destroyed during the warp-in period, the resource cost of the unit is fully refunded and the Warp Gate cooldown is reset to zero.[1] This is the only way to interrupt a warp-in; the warp-in will not be interrupted if the Warp Gate that started it is destroyed or unpowered. The order of Warp Gate use is determined by the proximity of the Warp Gate to the warp-in location; this can be used to find and Chrono Boost Warp Gates with longer cooldowns.[2]\n\n| Unit | Gateway Cooldown (s) | Warpgate Cooldown (s) | Chronoed (s) | Key |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Zealot | 27 | 20 | 13.3 | Z |\n| Sentry | 23 | 23 | 15.3 | E |\n| Stalker | 30 | 23 | 15.3 | S |\n| Adept | 30 | 20 | 13.3 | H |\n| High Templar | 39 | 32 | 21.3 | T |\n| Dark Templar | 39 | 32 | 21.3 | D |\n\nAll columns are in real-time seconds (at Faster speed).

{"document": "# Campaign/Breakout\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n#### First base\n\nOnce this is done, you'll approach the first Dominion base. It is protected by a few Siege Tanks, 2 turrets and bunkers and some troops. A factory will be producing hellions. Fortunately, you can get on the high ground on the left of the entrance and easily destroy a siege tank and even a bunker if you wish. You'll have to use Psi Shield to get in range of the turret to be able to destroy it. Wait for Raynor's troops to attack and use that diversion to destroy the turret. You'll take less damage, and along with the Psi Shield you should be able to take the turret and the Siege Tank out without losing any health. Move forward and destroy the other Siege Tank as it is not properly covered by the turret. Using Psi Shield to not get damaged by the hellions that are probably waiting there, destroy the turret.

This is a defensive build in that you are trying to get a better economy than your opponent. This build should be safe against most rushes given you take the appropriate defensive measures. After your Overlord, you should pump Drones if you see that he is playing passive and you should pump Roaches if he is starting to attack.\n\nThe underlying idea behind this build is that you can make up for your lesser number of Roaches in the time it takes for him to traverse the map. Thus you will have a superior economy and not die to his attack - and hence win the game. Thus, careful attention must be paid to how your opponent is playing in order to avoid dying to a rush strategy.\n\n## Transition\n\nLook to transition into a Roach/Hydralisk midgame with another expansion around 100 supply to a High Yield mineral field (if possible). It is strongly recommended you add two Evolution Chambers around 50 supply and begin upgrading Armor and Ranged Attack.\n\n## Countered By\n\n### Hard Counters\n\n- Any very fast rush like a 10 Pool Rush or a Spine Crawler rush\n\n### Soft Counters\n\n- Banelings and Roaches can be hard to deal with in this build\n\n## Counter To\n\n### Hard Counters\n\n### Soft Counters\n\n## Notable Maps\n\n### Strong\n\n- Desert Oasis\n\n- Large Maps\n\n### Weak\n\n- Steppes of War", "question": "In the 1 Base Roach Expand build order (vs. Zerg), what is the primary objective of the fast Hatchery expansion?", "options": ["To immediately produce more Roaches", "To secure a better economy than the opponent", "To defend against early Zergling rushes", "To prepare for a quick transition into Hydralisks"], "answer": "To secure a better economy than the opponent"}

It can be helpful at the start of missions to get going faster but it's of little use in the long term. You can already use M.U.L.E.s (see armory upgrades) and multiple command centers to stack worker queuing. It just isn't worth sacrificing Automated Refinery for.\n\nSuggested: Automated Refinery.

{"document": "# Baneling (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Baneling is a suicide bomber unit morphed from Zerglings after a Baneling Nest has been constructed.  Similar to the Infested Terran from Brood War, the Baneling is a suicidal unit that deals significant splash damage.\n\nBanelings have a splash radius of 2.2 and do not deal friendly fire damage to either your units or those of your allies. However, their attack range - unless manually detonated - is only 0.25, which is basically melee range and too short to go off from second row by themselves. But they can be detonated manually, and they will also perform their \"attack\" upon death.\n\nBanelings are a very effective unit against Light units due to their high damage bonuses in combination with splash damage. Correctly using a group of Banelings can deal massive damage to a hostile army and allow other units to clean up any remaining army much more easily. Because of their low survivability, getting Banelings to successfully hit groups of enemies is key. There are many options that can help a player use Banelings effectively:\n\n- The Burrow upgrade enables a player to hide his Banelings to act as a trap. When the opponent runs over your Banelings, detonate them while burrowed to wipe out entire groups by surprise.\n\n- The Baneling speed upgrade Centrifugal Hooks is also important for getting your Banelings into the action by cutting the time it takes to reach the front lines.\n\n- Tactical use of Creep Tumors can also help Baneling use by increasing their running speed.\n\n- Tactical placement of Banelings is important too; by flanking opponents you can deal even more damage and leave the opponent with no way to escape.\n\n- By using Overlords you can drop Banelings over an opponent's army to great effect.\n\n- Using the Infestor's Fungal Growth, you can keep the enemy from dodging your Banelings.\n\n- It is recommended one avoids attack moving their banelings for as long as possible. Attack moving into an army may cause banelings to focus units inefficiently (e.g. focusing a siege tank instead of a mass of marines or killing only one enemy zergling). Simply boxing or using a separate baneling control group to move command them towards more cost-efficient targets is important.\n\n- It takes two enemy baneling detonations to kill a baneling; therefore, it is beneficial to move banelings in groups of two and move command them when walking near enemy banelings. This can help min/max your unit's value with respect to total damage dealt and/or potentially cause the enemy to trade cost-inefficiently.\n\nTry to surround and attack, pull back a little and attack again. You don't want to waste Banelings on tanky units such as Marauders. You want to hit light units, so be wary of good players who will use these Armored units to shield their Light units.\n\nBanelings deal a lot of damage against structures, dealing significantly more damage that scales well with upgrades but they are very cost-ineffective. There are several things to note about Baneling damage vs. structures:\n\n- Exploding Banelings always deal extra damage to a building in range. That is, you do not have to use their Attack Structure ability on a building to deal the extra damage.\n\n- Baneling damage on buildings is not mitigated by armor, so that the 1 armor that most buildings possess and the Terran Building Armor upgrade that grants +2 armor does not affect Baneling damage.", "question": "What upgrade can help Banelings reach the front lines more quickly?", "options": ["Burrow", "Centrifugal Hooks", "Tunneling Claws", "Muscular Augments"], "answer": "Centrifugal Hooks"}

{"document": "# Proxy\n## Definition\n### Protoss\n\nProxy Pylons are extremely common in any Protoss push that occurs after Warpgate tech.  The ability to warp in groups of gateway units directly into the battle is extremely useful, and is essential for builds like the ubiquitous 4 gate. Proxy pylons can also augment an attack: for instance, building pylons along a retreat path will allow you to reinforce your army while getting farther away from the enemy's sources of reinforcement, and turn a losing battle into a more favorable outcome. Proxy pylons from different attack paths would also allow for better flanking, or for forcing the enemy to respond to engagements on multiple fronts.\n\nAgainst Terran, pylons may be used in the place of Observers along the edges of the map to spot for incoming drops. Although vision is limited to where a pylon can be placed, pylons do not cost gas and do not take up supply.\n\nOther buildings can be proxied. Against Terran and Protoss, a proxy Stargate will allow players to quickly send in an Oracle or two to harass the mineral line, to often devastating results if the proxy is unscouted. Proxy Tempest and Void Ray is less common and appears later in the game, but is still occasionally seen. A player can also hide a proxy Twilight Council in a place where it is unlikely to be found by enemy scouts, precluding a surprise Blink Strategy, or placing a Dark Shrine at the same proxy to allow for Dark Templar play.", "question": "What is the primary advantage of using proxy pylons in a Protoss push after Warpgate technology is achieved?", "options": ["To provide additional vision for detecting enemy units", "To warp in units directly into the battle zone", "To distract the enemy with decoy structures", "To increase the rate of resource collection"], "answer": "To warp in units directly into the battle zone"}

{"document": "# 2 Gate Fast Expand (vs. Protoss)\n## Introduction\n\nProtoss vs Protoss was one of the more controversial match-ups in Wings of Liberty. From the days of nothing but 4 Gating to the period of gigantic Colossus vs Colossus wars, many people scorned Protoss vs Protoss as the most boring, stale match-up in the game. However, in Heart of the Swarm it quickly became one of the more solid match-ups. With the addition of the Mothership Core and the viability of non-Robotics Facility builds, Protoss players are safer and more flexible than they have been in the past, allowing for a huge variety of openings and builds previously thought impossible. Among these builds, fast expands have emerged.\n\nThe 1 Gateway FE was originally the standard for Protoss vs. Protoss fast expands, but many of them started to get punished heavily by pressure builds and all-in timings. As a result, many Protoss players have begun to expand off of two Gateways instead. This variation allows a player to safely take a Nexus at a reasonable time while creating a catch-all, reactionary defense in order to transition into a stable mid-game.\n\nThis guide covers a variation of the 2 Gate Robo opening that gets a Nexus before Robo whilst still being safe from virtually all pressure through the use of Force Fields and Photon Overcharge. This guide will also cover how to scout and respond to common pressure and tech plays as well as how to transition into the mid-game safely.\n\nAlthough less economical than some other fast expands, this build withstands all forms of pressure. The combination of a Sentry first and a Mothership Core allows you to get away with minimal scouting while still getting a safe expansion and transitioning into Robotics Facility play. For players who are just starting to get a grip on macro games, this build is a go-to for its ease and stability.", "question": "In the context of a Protoss vs. Protoss match-up, what is the primary advantage of using a 2 Gate Fast Expand (FE) over a 1 Gate FE?", "options": ["It provides more economic benefit by producing units faster.", "It allows for a safer expansion with a catch-all defensive strategy.", "It is easier to execute and requires less micro-management.", "It focuses on an aggressive early-game strategy to overwhelm the opponent."], "answer": "It allows for a safer expansion with a catch-all defensive strategy."}

If the warning period elapses without a player completing any of these actions, then the game ends in a draw for all remaining players.  If a player completes any of these actions, the stalemate timer and the warning timer reset and play continues normally.\n\nThe conditions for a stalemate are precisely those described above.  In particular, the following actions will not break a stalemate:\n\n- Mine minerals or gas without returning them to a base\n\n- Begin production of a unit, construction of a building, or research of an upgrade without finishing it\n\n- Damaging but not destroying an enemy building\n\n- Destroying a non-enemy building (e.g., a neutral Supply Depot)\n\n- Damaging or killing any unit\n\n## Notes\n\n- A game can result in a tie without having a stalemate, if players/teams lose their last building simultaneously. This can occur if the last buildings are hit with a Nuke.\n\n## In Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm\n\nDue to the change of timing in Legacy of the Void, the timings are different in the last expansion than in Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Terran\n## The Early Game\n### Defending Hellion/Banshee Aggression\n\nPerhaps one of the most common strategies used for aggression when transitioning into the mid game is the combination of Hellions and Banshees to harass the Zerg while the Zerg is still trying to tech up to Lair and establish an strong economy. If you, the Zerg player, choose to go for a 2 base tech build, defending Hellion Banshee play shouldn't be a problem - you will have Speedlings out and nearly completed Lair tech to defend the Hellions. However, in general, whenever you see a Hellion/Banshee composition come out you need to:\n\n- Build one Spore Crawler per base\n\n- Build a Spore Crawler between your natural and your third (helps when jumping between bases)\n\n- Make ~16 Zerglings and 1-2 extra Queens\nI prefer to get one Spine Crawler at my third (helps in case you accidentally under-make Zerglings)\n\n- I prefer to get one Spine Crawler at my third (helps in case you accidentally under-make Zerglings)\n\nPosition the Zerglings to stop the Hellions from entering your natural or third. Remember, they're only there to prevent run-bys, not to chase Hellions. Basically, your goal is to defend without losing Drones until either your Terran opponent loses his units or until you get your Lair tech out. When the Terran player comes in with his Hellions, split the Zerglings, pull the Drones back, and move the Queens/Zerglings in. Queens should be used to focus down Banshees - they are the most dangerous units - while the Zerglings take care of Hellions. I prefer to not get Roaches unless I'm facing multiple Factories, a strategy by the Terran player that intends to catch you out of position.

{"document": "# 4\n## Reacting to the Zerg\n### Infestor Based Play\n\nYou will be focusing much less on pushing and much more on dropping (and scouting) when the Zerg goes for an Infestor style. Use small groups of Marines to push out and kill Tumors at the 11:30, 1/1 Stim timing, but be ready to flee at a moments notice. Eight Marines and one Medivac is a great group to do this with. Keep your army active on the map but not on Creep. On Creep you are very vulnerable to Infestors that just out of vision. Be wary of moving up mid-map ramps as they are another location that Infestors can abuse a clumped up army due to vision created by the high ground mechanic. Each time you see his army, back off and send a Medivac drop into one of his bases. Keep your harass units alive while active (run when he comes and go back in when he leaves). Once 2/2 kicks in, you can begin to do double Medivac drops and/or drops in multiple locations. Expand behind your harass and be prepared to deal with Hive tech level aggression.\n\nKeep in mind that the strengths of Infestor based play include the ability to defend pushes that run onto creep and a faster-than-normal hive. The answer to both of these items is drop play. With drop play as your focus, make the rest of your play support that idea. Adding a single Viking in the early mid-game can be extremely effective in reducing spotting Overlords that will help him defend drops. Use small portions of your army to kill creep and force his main army to show itself; this will allow you to drop the best positions when he is vulnerable.\n\nSome Zerg players will mix in a massive amount of static defense in order to counter the intuitive response of drop play from the Terran. Against such players, you should hold off on the drop harass and instead focus all of your energy into a pre-Hive-tech timing attack. Once the Zerg has finished his Hive, it will be about two minutes before hive units are in play. This is the time to attack. Ling/Bling/Infestor is much less robust at holding a large push at this timing than Muta/Ling/Bling, so as long as you push carefully you should win or trade in such a cost effective way as to hurt his Hive tech timing.\n\nKorean Terrans seem to favor a fast second Factory once their third base is up vs this style of play. Many Terrans will normally make Barracks six through eight before the second Factory, but when facing Infestor play, this is not the case. Also note, Marauders are much more useful here than against a Muta/Ling/Bling player, as they can be used to snipe Infestors before a battle.", "question": "When facing an Infestor-based Zerg strategy in StarCraft II, what is a recommended action to take with your army to avoid vulnerability to Infestors?", "options": ["Push aggressively onto Creep", "Keep your army on Creep at all times", "Keep your army active but off Creep", "Avoid moving your army at all"], "answer": "Keep your army active but off Creep"}

{"document": "# Mech (vs. Terran)\n## Positioning and micro\n\nSiege Tank positioning is the most important part of mech play. If your opponent is going bio or biomech you always run the risk of getting caught off guard by a quick stim while you're unsieged, and if both players are going mech, whoever can siege in range of the other player first often has the advantage. Using Hellions and Scanner Sweep to find out where your opponent's army is positioned is key, as it will allow you to know when you need to engage Siege Mode.\n\nChoosing where to siege is a somewhat easier, but much more important part of mech positioning - especially early in the game when your tank count is not very high. The general rules of arcs/concaves and chokes apply doubly when you're going for a tank-heavy style. Try to siege up just in range of any chokes available to you, and when moving out into open terrain you either need to know that your opponent's army count has been decimated or you need to be extra careful, leapfrogging slowly and spending extra scans/forward Hellions to reveal the enemy army's location.\n\nHellion positioning is also important. You want to keep at least some of them active on the map to harass and forcing your opponent into a defensive position, but you also want to keep the bulk of them near your Siege Tanks to soak up damage if a confrontation should occur.\n\nWhen advancing with Siege Tanks, Hellions and Thors should be spread out and sent in the front to soak up damage while your Siege Tanks are advancing and going into Siege Mode. You want to send them in as late as possible - if you send them in too early, they take unnecessary damage because your Siege Tanks aren't in range yet, but if you send them in too late you may lose Siege Tanks. Ideally you want to move your Siege Tanks forward first, then time it so your Hellions and Thors get in range of your opponent's Siege Tank line just before your Siege Tanks do.\n\nAir positioning can also be important - if your opponent has Marines, you don't want to send your air too far forward, you want them defended by your Siege Tanks. Against Thors (and Seeker Missile) it's very important not to stack your air units as that will allow the Thors to do maximum splash damage. It's also very easy for your air units to get drawn in by your opponent's forces, and if you don't pay attention some of them may get isolated and killed.", "question": "When advancing with Siege Tanks in StarCraft II, what should you ideally do with your Hellions and Thors to maximize their effectiveness?", "options": ["Keep them far behind the Siege Tanks to avoid damage.", "Send them in as late as possible to soak up damage while Siege Tanks advance.", "Deploy them immediately in front of Siege Tanks to engage the enemy.", "Position them randomly to confuse the enemy."], "answer": "Send them in as late as possible to soak up damage while Siege Tanks advance."}
{"document": "# Partin\n## Scouting\n### Holding SCV Pulls\n\nDefending SCV pulls is usually a matter of execution and scouting more than build specifics. Nevertheless, they are common and powerful enough that they are very worth discussing. As a general guideline, there are a few tips that show a Terran might be preparing to pull the boys:\n\n- Low SCV count: normally Terrans who want to bring the boys will only make about 50 of them without really saturating their third, and instead maximizing their army supply and relying on MULEs for income.\n\n- Passive mid game: if your opponent is playing passively, it's likely that he wants to save units to hit a big mid game timing, with or without SCVs.\n\n- No Armory, no second Engineering Bay, Ghost Academy or second Starport on the way: all these things maximize a Terran's army strength in the short-term against Colossus builds, especially if you are trying to get to Psionic Storm in the meantime.\n\nNote that these are just general guidelines, and many players simply decide to pull SCV when they feel ahead enough that they can end it with one big attack or too behind to be able to compete against both Storm and Colossi. Either way, you should always be active with an Observer and/or with hallucinations to check for army movements and have a rough idea of when this kind of huge attack is coming your way.\n\nThe most important adjustment to make to hold these attacks with a Colossus build is to have nonstop Colossus production until you have at least four as well as a good Stalker/Zealot force to support them. Investing in extra upgrades, Charge, a Templar Archives, oversaturating your third, or simply not having enough gateways ready in time is very likely to cause you to lose the game. As a general rule, if you don't think an upgrade or tech can be complete before the Terran's attack, do not invest into it and try to maximize your short-term army strength instead. A good general tip when going for a mass Colossus opening is to go up to eight to ten Gateways before taking the third base gases. This adjustment should give you enough production to defend most SCV pulls.\n\nAs soon as you see the boys coming your way, try to use your Blink Stalkers, along with ramps and force fields, to delay the attack. The longer the Terran isn't mining, the better, especially if you are waiting for any kind of investment to complete, whether that's upgrades, an extra Colossus, a set of Gateways or Storm. Be ready to sacrifice your third base if necessary. If you do decide to abandon your third, make sure that it doesn't supply block you.

Corruptors cannot shoot down, which makes them unable to harrass, but they are cheaper (6-10, 6 Corruptors 2shot Medivacs assuming equal upgrades), tankier, have more range, and automatically target Medivacs.  This allows the Zerg player to spend more gas on Banelings and more attention on microing the ground army to set off Widow Mines and get good Baneling detonations by move commanding past Thors and Marauders.  A Terran bio army is less effective once the Medivacs are gone, and Corruptors are good at sniping drops in transit, as well as Banshees, although they need ground support to clean drops if they've already unloaded.\n\n- Countering Vikings - - Terran players may choose to make Vikings to kill Zerg Brood Lords.

Originally planned as the spiritual successor to the StarCraft Goliath and the Thor's replacement, it was fashioned as a ground-attack only anti-mechanical unit by the Heart of the Swarm beta. Having high health, range, burst damage, and speed this unit was supposed to be effective at \"Hit and Run\" tactics, so long as it is not destroyed before coming into another unit's range.\n\nWhen Heart of the Swarm was first unveiled to the public, the Warhound was emphasised as the replacement for the Thor, having the same splash damage attack versus air units and a heavy burst attack, ideal against armored units and kite micro. By the release of the beta for the expansion, however, developers ended up opting for an anti-ground unit with bonus damage against Mechanical units with Haywire Missiles. This was intended to allow it to be competent against Siege Tank lines. Ironically, this is the one unit it is not economical against.\n\nIt became a main focus of the TvX Heart of the Swarm meta-game due to the absurdly high health and damage value for its cost. With a faster movement than the standard 2.25 for most units and range equivalent to a Stalker, it was especially powerful in early game rushes, able to kite all Barracks and certain Gateway units before Stimpack or Charge upgrades, and was removed as of Balance Patch #2 until it could be rebalanced. However it could not be rebalanced, and was simply removed from the game.\n\n## Abilities\n\nHaywire Missiles\nCaster: Warhound\nRange: 10\nCooldown: 6s\nHotkey: ?When attacking a mechanical unit, the Warhound launches electrically charged missiles at its target dealing 30 damage per volley.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\nFor the limited time that the Warhound was in the beta, it was often the focus of early game rushes and was widely accepted as imbalanced due to its low cost, high health and high damage.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Warhound models were used for the workers of every race on the ladder on April 1, 2013.[1][2]", "question": "Which unit is the Warhound strong against, according to the document?", "options": ["Stalker", "Siege Tank", "Roach", "Zealot"], "answer": "Stalker"}

This spreads out the Archons when the Vortex effect ends, minimizing the splash damage to your Brood Lords.\n\n- Don't forget to expand during the late game: the biggest strength of the Zerg late game is its ability to remax the quickest out of the three races. Hatcheries allow you to accumulate a bank and Larva to do just this.\n\n- Spread Creep aggressively to prevent the building of proxy Pylons. Be sure to scout out where your creep hasn't spread.\n\n- During an attack on your Natural Expansion, Sentries will often Force Field your ramp to prevent reinforcements from your main from arriving. This makes Sentries a high priority target.\n\n- Build a set of one Spine Crawler and one Spore Crawler at each of your bases if the game goes on longer.

These upgrades also affect the bonus damage of some units, for example the Immortal gains an additional 3 bonus damage against armored units per upgrade. Upgrades affect each attack, so if a unit attacks in volleys it will gain the bonus on each separate attack, rather than as a bulk addition to the whole attack. Note that attack upgrades do not apply to damage caused by abilities.\n\nAn example of an Attack Upgrade is:\n\nInfantry Weapons Level 1 Minerals: 100 Vespene Gas: 100 Build Time: 114\nResearched from: Engineering Bay\nIncrease the damage of Terran infantry units.", "question": "Which of the following statements about Attack Upgrades in StarCraft II is true?", "options": ["Attack Upgrades increase the damage dealt by abilities.", "Attack Upgrades do not affect bonus damage for certain units.", "Attack Upgrades apply to each separate attack in volleys.", "Attack Upgrades only increase the base damage by a fixed number."], "answer": "Attack Upgrades apply to each separate attack in volleys."}

Pay attention to your gas count so you can be precise in taking your Drones off gas. You can choose to leave 2 on gas for longer (pulling off at 90 Vespene Gas:) depending on what follow-up you may intend if the game doesn't end, but generally just gather what you need for the attack and enough for a couple of defensive Banelings in the worst case scenario. This way you have enough minerals for a Queen as well once the 18 Overlord hatches. Again, this is merely follow-up advice because, if well executed, you should deal crippling damage to your opponent.\n\n### Scouting\n\n- 2 player maps do not scout the opposing player until the first set of Zergling are ready to attack.\n\n- 4 player maps scout the position closest with a Drone and closest by air with an Overlord scout.\n\n## Execution\n\nAttack with the initial six Zerglings and retreat once the opposing player hatches opposing lings, and engage close enough to the opposing base to keep them contained until Baneling finish morphing, keep exchange Zerglings if you have more of them.\n\nWhen morphing Banelings, always morph them in pairs. Against a conservative hatch first opening, the opponent's Spawning Pool will be very near completion as your Zerglings enter your opponent's base.\n\n### Adaptation\n\n12 Pool Speed, Baneling Rush\nIf your opponent opts for a pool earlier than 10, you are at an advantage, and upon scouting equal or earlier Zerglings than yours, you can choose whether to continue with or abandon the build. If you choose to abandon the build, you should aim to produce two Queens immediately to block your ramp or use defensive Banelings to secure your Natural Expansion.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\n- Larger maps where your opponent is more likely to open Hatchery first.\n\n### Con features\n\n- Close air spawning positions", "question": "In the 10 Pool Baneling strategy, how many Drones should you transfer to gas once the Extractor is complete?", "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "answer": "3"}

{"document": "# Adel's Late Gas (vs. Protoss)\n## Basic Build Order\n### Notes\n\n- The Chrono Boost timings are extremely important! Make sure that you are executing them at the times given in the build order, as deviation from this will result in awkward timings of when you can construct what you need.\n\n- The attack at 4:40 to 4:50 is a timing that needs to be hit. If you have a slight variation in your build and end up with only three Zealots at this time, you still need to attack with them; it is more beneficial to hit your opponent before Warp Gate is up than to hit them with four Zealots when Warp Gate is finished.\n\n- It's generally a good idea to place your first two Gateways oriented slightly towards your opponent's base so as to get units from your initial Gateways to your enemy sooner.\n\n- Probes should be in constant production until you have your natural up and mining, unless you have to cut Probes to survive the first few rounds of attacks from a 4 Warpgate Rush.\n\nAssumption: You have good micro and good multitasking skills, than you can attack earlier, if he plays a 4 Warpgate Rush and skips his initial Zealot. Since the goal of your timing attack is to deal economic damage, you can attack with your initial Zealot. If you think you can deal significant damage (kill a Pylon, or at least two Probes) then go ahead and Chrono Boost it out and attack. Oftentimes lower level opponents will skip their initial Zealot trying to get Warp Gate researched as quickly as possible, and this is exploitable by chronoboosting out your first Zealot and attacking with it. Your Zealot should be at your opponent's base between 4:00 and 4:15. your opponent's stalker will not be ready until 4:16. This timeframe is extremely close.\n\nDo not try this, if\n\n- your scouting reveals a Chrono Boost on his gates,\n\n- the rush distance takes more than 50 seconds,\n\nor if your unsure about your skills (Micro and Multitasking).\n\nIt is extremely important to focus on your Macro with this build.

{"document": "# 4\n## Reacting to the Zerg\n### Zergling/Baneling/Mutalisk\n\nWhen you push out at 11:30 with 1/1 and Stim. Your goal is to contest map control from the Zerg. If you are out on the map, he cannot be harassing with Mutalisks. If you are out on the map, you can deny Creep and prevent future Creep from spreading. Do not make the mistake of overextending onto Creep during this timing; if you are on Creep, the Zerg will easily be able to win a battle. Do not hesitate to lift up all units into Medivacs and speed boost back to safety if the Zerg starts to gain a favorable position in battle. The goal of this 11:30 timing is do as much 'free' damage as possible to the Zerg. The objective is to kill Creep Tumors. Use Medivacs and Mines to ensure that you do not lose any units. The main target is Creep and you should be using Medivacs and Mines to ensure that you do not lose any units. The real attack is still yet to come and this aggressive poke helps to make that attack stronger.\n\nOnce you have 2/2 upgrades, your aggression should kick into high gear. This particular phase of the game will favor the player with better mechanics. Both players have options to harass and counterattack, and both players have scary armies to throw at each other. Many Terrans favor rallying across the map and doing large pushes that seem to never stop at this stage. Establish your fourth base and add three more Barracks with Tech Labs and a Factory with Tech Lab (for Widow Mine burrow upgrade).\n\nOther mid game production composition are possible besides the standard 8/2/1 Barracks/Factory/Starport setup described in the above paragraph. Flash uses a 7/2/1 (five Reactor'd Rax and two Tech Lab'd) that really favors and focuses in on the constant rally style of aggression. Polt has shown a 8/3/1 style where he gets his second Factory rather quickly (with the Tech Lab for the Burrow upgrade) and then a third Factory with a Reactor so that he can make five Widow Mines at a time.\n\nAfter the Zerg moves to Hive tech, you need to establish if he is going for Brood Lords or for Ultras. Ultras are by far the most common but you cannot assume them. Against both Ultras and Brood Lords, you need to begin sending drops as much as possible. You require a heavy Marauder count vs Ultras and (at least) a second Starport vs Brood Lords. Try to maximize the cost effectiveness of every engagement and keep up on your production. It is rare to need to go to a fifth base but do not let yourself be caught mining out your natural and third with no fifth established. On either four or five bases, you have the option to begin a transition to Ravens/BCs/Vikings (not necessarily all three, usually either BC/Viking or Raven/Viking at first). Be careful in doing so as it does leave you a bit weaker until you have reached a certain critical mass. If you feel that you have a slight lead but his defense is too strong for you to kill him, you might be in an ideal situation to transition like this.", "question": "What is the primary goal of pushing out with 1/1 and Stim at 11:30 in StarCraft II against Zerg?", "options": ["To destroy the Zerg's main base", "To harass and deny Creep spread", "To test the Zerg's army strength", "To establish a fourth base"], "answer": "To harass and deny Creep spread"}

While burrowed, units do not contact other non-burrowed units aside buildings, although they do contact other burrowed units in Starcraft II. Most  units have their sight reduced by 4 while burrowed. The exceptions to this are the Infestors, Banelings and Swarm Hosts, which do not suffer from reduced vision when burrowed, and Infested Terrans, which have their sight reduced by 5. Burrowing requires a brief period to complete, which varies between different units.\n\nSimilar to cloaked units, burrowed units can be spotted by keen players who notice a shadow-like cloud on terrain.\n\nBurrow is a research that enables this for almost all Zerg ground units researched from any Zerg Hatchery. Larvae, Eggs, Cocoons, Broodlings, Nydus Worms, Changelings and Locusts are the only units that cannot learn to burrow.\n\nRoaches can research a separate burrowing capability with movement and regeneration while burrowed from the Roach Warren.

Attacks should be quick and brief so as not to deplete the Medivac's energy too quickly.\n\nThe Medivac can drop Marines and Marauders and then support them with healing to make the drop even more dangerous. It can also move (unsieged) Siege Tanks, Hellions and Thors allowing for many options for harassment, be it shelling a base from a cliff or dropping Hellions into a mineral line to deal large economic damage.

These Stalkers are what are going to keep a player alive against a good 4 Warpgate Rush. Use them to kill off the Zealot, Stalker, and Probe (if you can) and then snipe the proxy Pylon.

To hold off the rush, the player must force the proxy Pylon a good distance away from the player's ramp.\n\nScouting the opponent Protoss base early game should not be easy because of a Stalker/Sentry after the Cybernetics Core. However, around 21 food you should send in a probe to see what he is doing for 2 reasons: 1) If your opponent is going Zealot heavy, you will notice quickly, and 2) It is easy to get supply blocked at 25/26 while making the 3rd Stalker, by sacrificing your probe, you bring the supply down to 24/26 and you can get the 3rd Stalker without supply blocking yourself.\n\nWhen scouting the middle of the map, should the opponent's Zealot and two Stalkers be encountered, an engagement can occur and be won with proper micro.

{"document": "# Corruption\n\nCorruption\nAbility Information\nCaster(s):Corruptor\nCost: Minerals: 0  0\nRange:6\nCooldown:45\nDuration:30 (Corruptor)\nResearched from:No research needed\n\n## Description\n\nThis was removed in LotV. The Corruptor corrupts an enemy unit, increasing its damage taken by 20% for 30 seconds. Corruption increases all forms of damage taken by the corrupted unit, including both standard attacks and damage from spells. For example, an Armored unit would normally take 40 damage from Fungal Growth, but if that unit were affected by Corruption, the unit would take 48 damage instead. When calculating the damage done in an attack, Corruption is applied after bonus damage and attack upgrades, but before armor and shield upgrades.\n\n## Use\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nProtoss are currently (as of patch 1.03) having some difficulty dealing with Brood Lords; since Corruptors can overwhelm a Protoss air force and transition into Brood Lords, it makes a certain amount of sense to use Corruptors either in support of a ground army or as a direct response to Protoss air power. In this role, Corruption serves the following purposes:\n\n- Giving the Corruptor an edge against Carriers, Void Rays, and Phoenixes.\n\n- Improving the Corruptor's damage against Colossi, permitting both the Corruptor and any other units to kill Colossi more quickly.\n\n- Assisting Brood Lords and Mutalisks against Stalkers: Stalkers are both large enough to be easily targeted with Corruption and tough enough to merit it.\n\n- Affects Immortal's Hardened Shield increasing the maximum amount of damage to 12. This means that Roaches can remove the Immortal's shields in one fewer shot [1]. Also, an unupgraded Hydralisk does full damage to a Corrupted, unupgraded Immortal.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nThough most Terran units either die too easily to merit Corruption (Marines) or cannot directly strike back against the Corruptor at all (Banshees, Ravens), there are a few circumstances in which Corruption can give the Zerg an edge:\n\n- Naturally, against Battlecruisers and, in some circumstances, Vikings.\n\n- Either in support of ground units against Thors, or to give Mutalisks or Brood Lords an edge against them.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\n- Excellent for use in thinning out enemy Corruptor numbers and taking out Brood Lords more quickly.\n\n- Use against Ultralisks to increase damage dealt by ground forces\n\n## Other\n\nAside from its obvious usage as a method to ensure that formidable air units die quickly, Corruption can be used on ground units, but not on Structures.  In this capacity, the Corruptor can indirectly assist against ground armies by Corrupting particularly significant targets (Thors, Ultralisks, Colossi, Siege Tanks, or Immortals).\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ Without Corruption: 10 shots * 10 damage = 100 damage to shields. With Corruption: 9 shots * 12 damage = 100 damage on shields and 7 damage to HP, as Immortals have a base armor of 1", "question": "When Corruption is applied to a unit, at which stage of damage calculation is it applied?", "options": ["Before bonus damage and attack upgrades", "After bonus damage and attack upgrades, but before armor and shield upgrades", "Before armor and shield upgrades", "After all other damage calculations"], "answer": "After bonus damage and attack upgrades, but before armor and shield upgrades"}

{"document": "# 4 Warpgate Rush\n## Execution\n### PvT\n\n- Almost all PvT builds take the 4 Gate rush into account, so it's important that the Terran doesn't know that you're rushing them. If they manage to work it out, then they should be able to make extra Bunkers at either their natural choke or the top of their main ramp, and you will never be able to break a Terran with >3 repaired Bunkers whilst using this all-in.\n\n- You'll generally want to use Zealots and Sentries in your attack. If you can trap Terran units against the Zealots using Force Fields then the Zealots will make short work of them, especially if they're underneath a Guardian Shield. Force Fields can also be used to prevent the Terran from repairing Bunkers (or other structures), which will make it much easier to bust through their defences.\n\n- If you see 3 Bunkers or more, or 2 Bunkers that already have SCVs ready to repair them, then it means the Terran is on to you and that you'll have no chance of breaking them. You should abandon your rush and take an expansion, spending as much Chrono Boost on Probes as possible in order to catch-up with the Terran, or try to run beyond the Bunkers if the Terran doesn't have a complete wall-off.\n\n- If the opponent has stayed in their main base, but has enough Bunkers to defend your rush, you should be able to set-up a Forcefield contain whilst securing your expansion. The Terran won't be able to break your contain until Medivacs are available, at which point you will need to retreat to defend possible drop harassment.\n\n- If the opponent is building Marauders then try to focus them down first; this is as the Concussive Shells upgrade prevents your Stalkers from cost-effectively kiting against Marines.", "question": "In a 4 Gate rush against a Terran player in StarCraft II, what can Protoss players use to prevent Terran from repairing their Bunkers, making it easier to break through their defenses?", "options": ["Zealots", "Colossi", "Force Fields", "Carriers"], "answer": "Force Fields"}

{"document": "# Proxy\n## Definition\n### Zerg\n\nZerg proxies are the least common. Because all Zerg production happens at the same building, only the Proxy Hatch is a useful Zerg proxy. However, a player can block expansions by first building a Hatchery, cancelling it, and then using the small residual patch of creep to build another building, such as an Evolution Chamber. The high HP of the building means that a player who was attempting to expand early will need to spend both time and resources clearing away the building, at a relatively low cost of 175 minerals to the Zerg player.\n\nAgainst another Zerg, a player can also bring a Drone along to make into a Spine Crawler. Once made, it can be rooted anywhere on the enemy creep and defended with the player's own Zerglings and other drones. It makes an early pool rush far more difficult to repel, and generally will force the defending player to get a Spine Crawler of his own to defend key structures and the mineral line.\n\nHidden tech is more common for Zerg after Lair tech has been achieved, enabling the Generate Creep ability for Overlords. Since a Zerg player can quickly use all of his available Larva to make units that to a scouting player would only appear as Eggs, a hidden tech building such as a Spire means that a large mass of units will be available to the Zerg player with very little warning to an unsuspecting enemy.", "question": "What is a common strategy for Zerg players to block enemy expansions after achieving Lair tech?", "options": ["Building a hidden Spire to quickly generate units", "Constructing a Spine Crawler at the enemy's base", "Deploying a large number of Zerglings to the enemy's mineral line", "Building a Hatchery and then cancelling it to create a blocking structure"], "answer": "Building a hidden Spire to quickly generate units"}

{"document": "# Campaign/Maw of the Void\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n\nThe Rip-Field Generators are your main obstacle from taking the artifact. They slowly deal damage to anything that's inside their area of effect. Protoss are not affected as their shields protect them, and the only Terran units that can survive long enough to destroy the generators are Battlecruisers. Because of that, they'll be your main attack force.\n\nYou start the mission with three Battlecruisers and you must clear a Landing Zone for your base to be able to land. There are several Stalkers there guarding the Rip-Field Generator and you shouldn't have problems taking them out. The Battlecruisers are slowly losing health points when they are inside a Rip-Field, so quickly kill the Generator.\n\nAfter your base has landed, start adding a Tech Lab to the Starport so you can start building more Battlecruisers. Eventually, a Viking would also help as it'll be very helpful to grab the resources containers all around the map. Just make sure not to go inside a Rip-Field with a Viking, as it would die immediately.\n\nThe Protoss will be attacking your starting island after a few minutes. They'll drop Archons, Stalkers, Zealots and Immortals using Warp Prisms, so be ready to kill them with your Battlecruisers. In your free time, kill the rest of the Protoss forces on your island so you can quickly take the resources containers there as they'll help a lot at the beginning. Consider adding a second Starport if you don't have the Tech Reactor Research. You'll have enough resources to support building two BCs at a time.\n\nOnce You have about 6 or 7 Battlecruisers, you can start moving out to the next Rip-Field Generator. Use the Yamato Cannon of your BCs to destroy the Photon Cannons and quickly destroy the Generator. You can take the base here as it has much more minerals than your original base, and at this point it probably is mined out anyway.\n\nFrom there, just keep producing Battlecruisers and repair them when they take damage, you can also upgrade their weapons and armor, take the resources scattered around the map with a Viking, and free the imprisoned Dark Templars as they can be helpful to kill some enemy Stalkers while your BCs are under repair. Remember, Protoss units are unaffected by the Rip-Field while they still have shields. The enemy has some Cannons so be careful not to be seen by them with your DTs and you should be able to do some damage. Most of the Generators are not reachable by melee units, so the Dark Templars won't be able to kill those, focus on killing enemy units and unprotected buildings.\n\nWhen you get closer to the Xel'Naga Vault, a Mothership will warp in. It's troublesome because unlike its Multiplayer counterpart, this Mothership still has its teleportation ability. You can avoid it completely by destroying the Xel'Naga vault before it gets to you, or you can take it out by focus firing it down with a ton of Yamatos. You'll need to do this multiple times though, as the Mothership will use Vortex on your Battlecruisers, and it will teleport back a few times.\n\nOnce you're at the Xel'Naga Vault, you can just focus it with your Battlecruisers. It doesn't have a lot of health points and the mission ends right after it is destroyed, so if you want to finish it quickly, just kill it without being afraid of losing a Battlecruiser or two.

{"document": "# Zealot (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nAgainst Zerg, Adepts have surpassed Zealots at applying early pressure as shade provides an excellent escape or way to scout without being placed in harm's way. The effectiveness of Zealots against Zerglings often comes down to positioning: Zealots are very effective when they engage Zerglings with even surface areas.(like when Zealots and lings are at even numbers, or the engagement occurs at chokes or against walls) However, if Zerglings are able to surround a small group of Zealots, the Zealots will die very quickly. This dynamic is extremely important in the PvZ early game especially in scenarios where the Zerg opens with a build such as a 12 pool.\n\nOnce enough Roaches have been built, Zealots become ineffective without some combination of support units such as Stalkers, Sentries, or Immortals. The Charge upgrade is very useful, especially against ranged Zerg units such as Hydralisks.\n\nBanelings can be very effective against massed Zealots, especially if groups Charge into them. However, a trick to minimize losses is to split the Zealots effectively reducing the damage dealt by Banes.\n\nZealots (with Charge) together with Archons and Immortals form the army composition of Immortal Archon Chargelot (IAC). This composition supported by High Templar with Storm is an excellent composition that scales into the lategame.\n\nCharge Zealots (Chargelots) are much more effective harassment units in the PvZ matchup than they are as front line combat units. The boost to their base movement speed allows them to roam the map and wipe out drone lines in seconds, paired with a warp prism they can be a thorn for the Zerg player and have the potential to bleed them out over the course of the game if not dealt with correctly.\n\nThe +1 weapons upgrade is an important upgrade when fighting Zerglings or Hydralisks. This allows a Zealot to kill a Zergling (35 HP) in two attacks ((8+1)x2 x2=36) instead of three and a Hydralisk in five attacks instead of six.  This reduces a lot of overkill, making an engagement with Zerglings and Hydralisks much more effective.", "question": "What upgrade is crucial for Zealots when fighting Zerglings or Hydralisks to reduce overkill and make engagements more effective?", "options": ["Charge", "+1 Armor", "+1 Weapons", "Psionic Storm"], "answer": "+1 Weapons"}

{"document": "# Spawn Larva\n## Use\n\nSpawn Larva is the most powerful ability at the Queen's disposal. At every possible chance, the Queen's energy should be used to spawn additional Larva at a particular Hatchery. One Queen will recover enough energy to constantly spawn Larva at one Hatchery. This ability increases the ability of Zerg to produce any type of unit. As a general rule of thumb, each base the Zerg obtains can support one Hatchery with a Queen and its Spawn Larva ability.\n\nWhen opening with Zerglings it is especially important to be using Spawn Larva at every available opportunity. The low cost of Zerglings and Drones means Larvae are used up very quickly. Missing even a single Spawn Larva while building primarily Zerglings and Drones can result in a stiff halt in production.\n\nA Hatchery with fewer than 3 Larva will naturally spawn one Larva per 11 seconds. To maximize Larva production, it is important to quickly use the Larva spawned via Spawn Larva, so that it does not suppress the natural spawning process.\n\nThis spell can also be used on allied Hatcheries. For example, on team maps with close starting positions, one zerg can pursue Lair tech right after the Spawning Pool, while his team mate transfers a Queen (after casting spawn larva on her \"home\") over. This is usually followed by a Vespene donation as soon as e.g. Mutalisks become available.", "question": "What is the primary benefit of using the Spawn Larva ability in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It increases the speed of unit movement.", "It increases the Zerg's ability to produce any type of unit.", "It grants the Queen additional health points.", "It allows the Queen to attack enemy units more effectively."], "answer": "It increases the Zerg's ability to produce any type of unit."}

{"document": "# Sight Blockers\n\nLine of Sight Blocker\nUnit Information\nType:Doodad\nDescription:Blocks line of sight for ground units.Unit stats\nDefense: Hit Points: 0  Armor: 1\n\nSight Blockers or \"Line-of-sight(LOS) Blockers\" are a feature on some StarCraft II maps. They manifest themselves as High Grass or Smoke Billows that hide whatever is behind it from sight: your units need to walk through them to see what's on the other side. Sight Blockers can be used to lay an ambush or to hide units. On some maps like Metalopolis and Scrap Station a small part of your base is hidden from sight - a popular place for hiding proxies.\n\nSight Blockers can have different appearances, such as tall grass, or exhaust fumes. The different appearances do not change their function.\n\nSight Blockers prevent ground units on one side from seeing anything past their vertical plane. Air units are unaffected, and ground units are only affected by sight blockers if the controlling player does not otherwise have vision of the opposite side.\n\n## Notable Uses\n\n- As mentioned, many mains have a corner sanctioned off by LOS blockers, providing good spots for Nydus Worms, drops, early game proxies, and many other strategies. The player the main belongs to sees everything as normal unless they have a unit/building inside the LOS blocked region.\n\n- Sight Blockers in the open field can be useful for melee or short ranged units that need to close in on long ranged units. An example would be camping a Zealot army next to the closest Xel'Naga Tower (this area is enclosed by gas vents that act as LOS blockers), knowing that the enemy Marauder force will take that route to get to your base. The Marauders only start shooting the Zealots once they have gone into the vents and seen them, at that time, the Zealots are already on top of the Marauders, and the Zealots have a fighting chance.\n\n- Conversely, LOS Blockers are also useful for long ranged units because in SC2 you are not given sight to the enemy units that attack you. Placing Siege Tanks behind sight blockers means opposing ranged units like Hydralisks need to walk all the way up to the siege line before they can see the tanks to fight back, by that time they should be dead.\n\n- Sight Blockers provide an optimal spot for Banelings. The Banelings can't be seen until it is too late and the enemy forces are right on top of them. Of course, once the Banelings have burrow, this can be accomplished anywhere.", "question": "Which of the following units is unaffected by Sight Blockers in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Zealots", "Marauders", "Nydus Worms", "Air units"], "answer": "Air units"}

{"document": "# Ultralisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nUltralisks are useful against both Terran bio balls of Marine/Marauder and mech armies of Tanks and Thors. Since Terrans can usually produce Vikings quickly, Ultras are usually preferred over Broodlords as the go-to unit. When used in conjunction with the Infestor, Ultralisks with their cleave ability can demolish bio balls rooted by Fungal Growth. Ultras will often serve as the vanguard of a Zerg push, breaking siege lines and bio balls with their high armor and large health pool.\n\nUltralisks do particularly well versus bio balls composed of mostly marines, as 3/3 Marines only do 2 damage versus Ultralisks with Chitinous Plating. This means that if a bio player is suprised by an Ultralisk transition, the game can turn very awkward for them as their Marines will do practically no damage and they will have to produce higher tech units such as Marauders or Liberators to deal with the Ultrakisks before they are overwhelmed. It should be noted that a bio composition with a large number of Marauders can kite down Ultralisks effectively, but this also makes bio armies much more vulnerable to Zerglings and Hydralisks as they will have much lower DPS against unarmored units without Marines. The bio armies Medivacs will also become much more vulnerable to being sniped by Mutalisks or Corruptors as Marauders can't shoot up.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that bio armies including Ghosts using the Steady Targeting ability can be very cost-effective against Ultras, so rooting the bio force in place with Fungal Growth is recommended to gain favorable engagements.\n\nUltralisk use vs. Terran has changed since the Ultralisk damage buff and the introduction of Widow mines.

Thus, it is important for the Protoss to keep tabs on the Zerg's army's location with scouting units such as the Oracle and the Observer, and important to meet it when it tries to attack. Keep in mind that Lurker-heavy armies aren't very good at engaging directly into enemy armies, because the Lurker must first burrow, giving the Protoss army time to pick off the Lurkers or to retreat.\n\nContrary to first impressions Disruptors are less useful against this unit.

If faster units like Zerglings, or ranged units, like Stalkers and Marines, are chasing it though, it will die in a heartbeat. Reapers are very fragile, but make up for it with their speed (which can be upgraded further at the Tech Lab). This is why kiting with it is so effective.\n\n- Viking.

Hellions are one of the most mobile units Terrans have access to. Against Zerglings and Zealots kiting is essential both to minimize damage received and to maximize damage dealt.

This reliance is so heavy a player will ignore any economic progress in exchange for an attack.\n\nCheese relies so much on this attack that if the player fails to inflict crippling damage or win the game outright, they will be economically behind to a large degree. At this point, the rest of the game should become an exercise in futility.\n\nWe must keep in mind Starcraft 2 has many variables and win conditions. We cannot ignore a player's ability/rank while attempting to apply this definition. There will be some cases in which a player will come back to win the game regardless of their failed attempt at cheesing. However, this will become less likely as a player's skill and rank improve but will never become absolute.\n\nCheese is usually characterized by its strategic fragility. The cheesing player is making a wager that the defending player will have some sort of oversight in his build. Examples are: Lack of detection against Dark Templars or Banshees, lack of anti-air against certain Stargate builds, or economic greediness against a two raxing Terran. However, the cheesing player is usually putting himself at a large deficit in the long run by attempting to expose this weakness.

Others invest in early tech that must be countered in a specific way. Some are more nuanced: seven and five Roach into Speedling Zerg vs Protoss, and Hellion into two port Banshee pressure Terran vs Zerg, rely on forcing a certain enemy tech choice and then countering it decisively as it is deployed (In the first case the Roaches bust the wall and force Stalkers; in the second case the Hellions force speed/Spines/Queens/Roaches and delay Lair). Here, the cheesing player gains the advantage by assuming that his opponent will react to what he sees in a \"smart\" way. Like most cheese, these builds are much easier to stop once a player has gained a familiarity with them.

While doing so, Mutalisks should be manually assigned targets rather than attack-moving so that they will focus fire and kill the same unit rather than injure a number of units.\n\nDue to their relatively slow acceleration, Mutalisks should be continually moved at full speed even when there is no harm in sight - this allows them to easily escape at full speed when defenders arrive.", "question": "What is the recommended strategy for managing Mutalisks during combat to ensure efficient target elimination and survival?", "options": ["Attack-moving to spread damage among multiple units while staying in range.", "Focusing on a single target by manually assigning targets and retreating during cooldowns.", "Maintaining a stationary position to maximize damage output on a single target.", "Randomly selecting targets to confuse the enemy and spread out the Mutalisks."], "answer": "Focusing on a single target by manually assigning targets and retreating during cooldowns."}
{"document": "# Chrono Boost\n\nChrono Boost\nSpell Information\nCaster(s):Nexus\nCost: 50\nCooldown:0\nDuration:20 s (Nexus)\nResearched from:No research needed\n\nChrono Boost is the Protoss macro mechanic for StarCraft II. Located at the Nexus, this ability can be activated using 50 energy and is used to increase the production or research speed at the target building by 50%. This allows the building to do 30 seconds of work in 20 seconds, so production/research will complete 10 seconds earlier. This will work on any unit production and research building, creating interesting decision-making scenarios where you must choose between opting for faster tech and faster unit production.\n\n## Use\n\nBesides speeding production and research, Chrono Boost also accelerates ability cooldowns, notably on Warpgates. It can also be cast on a Nexus to hurry the Strategic Recall cooldown, though casting it on more than one Nexus does not stack this effect.\n\nWhile Chrono Boost cannot be used on an ally's buildings in a team game, if you control Zerg or Terran buildings they can also be Chrono Boosted. It can be cast on any Zerg or Terran production or research building. Zerg Cocoons cannot be Chrono Boosted. Chrono Boost will also accelerate morphing buildings (such as Planetary Fortresses) and on the timer for Spawn Larva used by Queens. It will also accelerate a Hatchery's larva production and Creep spread.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\nAgainst all three races, Chrono Boost is often used to hasten Probe production in order to have a stronger economy. Later, many Protoss players use Chrono Boost on upgrades such as Warp Gate from Technological structures as well as unit production structures.\n\nSee Chrono Boost Math for more technical details on Chrono Boost usage.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nIn the mirror match-up it is arguably most important to monitor the usage of Chrono Boost in the early game. Since the Warp Gate timing is critical, scouting the use of Chrono Boost on the Cybernetics Core with your first Probe may be the only warning you can obtain of an impending 4 Gate rush. The amount of stored Chrono Boost on a Nexus in PvP can also be a clue that it is being saved to chain-chrono the Warpgate tech research.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nWith fast expand builds, chrono boost can be used to pump units out of a single gateway to gain just enough units to defend against pressure. See, for example, 1 gate FE, which uses a Zealot and two Stalkers Chrono Boosted out of a single Gateway to defend the early Nexus.\n\nIn the case of needing detection in time to prevent damage from Cloaked Banshees, Chrono Boosting out the first Observer or two helps.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nChrono Boost is often used on a Gateway for early Zealot pressure, as described here.\n\n## Other\n\nChronoboost may be used through the minimap.  Zerg that Neural Parasite a Probe and build a Nexus can chronoboost any buildings they own. Chronoboost can be seen through the Fog of War (this is a bug apparently).\n\n## Trivia\n\n- From the start of LotV to Patch 4.0.0, Chrono Boost had a far lower effect (15%), but did not expire. This is also how it works in the Campaign. Since Chrono Boost has returned to costing energy, it is no longer a global speed buff on its target, but rather a buff on categories of behaviours: Charge (not Energy), Cooldown, Creep, Morph, Progress, Queueable, Spawn. Chrono Boost no longer affects movement speed, Health, Energy, or Shield regeneration.\nA Terran building that was Chrono Boosted could fly faster.[1]\nChrono Boosting a damaged Protoss building made the shields regenerate faster and Chrono Boosting a Zerg building made it regenerate health faster.\nAs of 2010, Chrono Boost increased energy regeneration by 15%[2]\n\n- A Terran building that was Chrono Boosted could fly faster.[1]\n\n- Chrono Boosting a damaged Protoss building made the shields regenerate faster and Chrono Boosting a Zerg building made it regenerate health faster.\n\n- As of 2010, Chrono Boost increased energy regeneration by 15%[2]", "question": "Which of the following buildings can be affected by Chrono Boost to accelerate the production of units or research, but cannot have Zerg Cocoons Chrono Boosted?", "options": ["Nexus", "Hatchery", "Planetary Fortress", "Cocoon"], "answer": "Hatchery"}

{"document": "# Proxy\n## Definition\n\nA proxy building is a building built outside your own base including your natural base, generally in the proximity of your opponent's base. Despite the similarity between the words 'proximity' and 'proxy', the term actually stems from the word 'proxy' as something which in acts on behalf of someone or something else. Proxy structures do not necessarily need to be in closer proximity to the opponent, any structure built outside one's base is a proxy structure. 'Proxy' can be used either as an adjective (proxy barracks), a verb (the player will proxy four barracks), or a noun (the player's proxy in the opponent's natural).\n\nThere are two main reasons why proxies are useful. First, proxies allow your attacking units to be built closer to the enemy, which will cut down on rush time and allow you to reinforce your army more quickly.  Second, if placed correctly, proxies are unlikely to be scouted by the enemy, and this may give the player the element of surprise.\n\nOther reasons to proxy a building include: scouting, keeping an important building safe from a main base attack, or simply confusing your opponent.", "question": "What is the primary benefit of placing a proxy building near your opponent's base in StarCraft II?", "options": ["It allows you to build attacking units closer to the enemy, reducing rush time.", "It helps in keeping the building safe from main base attacks.", "It provides better scouting opportunities.", "It confuses your opponent."], "answer": "It allows you to build attacking units closer to the enemy, reducing rush time."}

{"document": "# APM\n\nAPM is short for \"Actions per Minute\" and is an average or instantaneous measure of the rate at which a player can perform actions (including spam, see EPM)\n\n## StarCraft II\n\nIn replays you can see how many APM a player is having in average and in real time. The APM in StarCraft II is calculated from Normal Game Speed. If you want to know the APM of a player that has played on the Faster game speed, you must therefore multiply the APM shown in the replay with 1.38. E.g. a player is shown to have 100 APM in the replay but if he played on faster game speed, it is therefore 100*1.38 = 138.\n\n## Other\n\nAPM is sometimes used by some people as a measure of skill. This is generally incorrect, as what is known as \"spamming\" can highly inflate the APM for a player. Day[9] very elegantly summarizes the disparity between APM and skill as such - high APM doesn't make anyone a better player, but better players have higher APM because they have much better game sense and awareness. He further elaborates that newer players get sucked into the \"APM = skill\" fallacy, and think that being good in StarCraft (or any RTS) comes down to mouse speed. Then, if they are unable to achieve a high enough mouse speed they are turned off and stop playing.\n\nHigh APM (outside of spam) is the direct result of game awareness; a strong player is performing actions at several different levels such as micro-managing their units, continuing harvester production, erecting new buildings, and scouting throughout the game. Simply because the player is aware that these actions must be performed and has a sense of what needs doing, they give the impression of preternatural speed and reflex. Their APM is just a result of them doing what needs to be done. Many new players try to unnecessarily increase their APM using custom maps. It is generally suggested that the only time you need to actively increase your APM is when your brain is working faster than your hands and you can't keep up. The human ability to carry out thoughts with actions is quite impressive and you'll be surprised how sufficiently high your APM can get just by playing the game normally.", "question": "In StarCraft II, how should the APM of a player who played on Faster game speed be calculated from the replay APM?", "options": ["Divide the replay APM by 1.38", "Multiply the replay APM by 1.38", "Multiply the replay APM by 1.5", "No adjustment is needed"], "answer": "Multiply the replay APM by 1.38"}

This is the Windows term for mouse acceleration. It is enabled by default. Mouse acceleration increases the cursor speed based on the velocity of the mouse, i.e., the faster the mouse is moved, the faster the cursor moves. This means Windows is artificially adjusting the input of the mouse.\n\nSome mice have acceleration built into their driver, which can be configured/disabled in their specific software options. Many laser sensors have slight CPI variances that are speed-dependent, which is commonly referred to as \"acceleration built into the hardware\" but is in fact simply inaccuracies and should not properly be called acceleration. Consult online resources and reviews before buying a mouse.\n\nCertain players prefer to have acceleration enabled, but it is typically recommended that mouse acceleration be turned off. Universally constant mouse movements facilitate better imprinting on muscle memory. Simply put, the mouse and the cursor should always move the same way. However, personal preferences vary.\n\nTo turn mouse acceleration off on Windows, clear the \"Enhance Pointer Precision\" box. This disables mouse acceleration. However, some older games call for the OS to temporarily re-enable the acceleration feature while in-game. A workaround is to simply modify the acceleration curve in Windows Registry such that it corresponds to 1-to-1 movement. This can be done with open-source utilities like Pointer Speed Setter, which also lets you set finer increments of Windows sensitivity not accessible from Control Panel, if you so prefer.\n\nThis change may or may not be permitted in sanctioned play. However, under no circumstances can be it be called a \"hack\" or \"cheat;\" it is perfectly legal, merely inaccessible from the Windows GUI.", "question": "Why is it generally recommended to turn off mouse acceleration in games like StarCraft II?", "options": ["It increases the sensitivity of the mouse, making it harder to control.", "It can cause inconsistent cursor movement, disrupting muscle memory.", "It makes the game run slower due to increased processing requirements.", "It is considered a cheat and can lead to disqualification in competitions."], "answer": "It can cause inconsistent cursor movement, disrupting muscle memory."}

Players can switch between these two modes at will, but the transition requires two seconds each time.\n\nIn Transport Mode, the Warp Prism functions as a mobile transportation ship, capable of transporting up to eight units by air to different locations on the map. Transport Mode is the initial mode of the Warp Prism when it warps in, and only needs to be reactivated should the Warp Prism enter Phasing Mode.\n\nWhen the Warp Prism enters Phasing Mode, it becomes immobile, hovering in the air while it creates a small circle of Pylon power (the Psionic Matrix) underneath it with a radius of 3.75 (compared to a Pylon's power radius of 6.5). This power provides all of the benefits of a Pylon in terms of warping in buildings and units. It does not however, provide Psi supply as Pylons do. Players are still able to load and unload units from the Warp Prism while it is in Phasing Mode.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\n- The Warp Prism will primarily deploy into Phasing Mode when the Protoss player has Warpgates, so that they can quickly warp in units on site. This ranges from quick reinforcements near a battle to dropping units behind enemy lines, frequently as sneak attacks in an opponent's base. In either case, Phasing Mode is a quick and very mobile means of deploying Protoss troops all across the map. While the Warp Prism is deployed and remaining in Phasing Mode, it is fully exposed to any anti-air attacks, and so it is recommended to warp in support for it immediately after deploying.\n\n- Should the Protoss player's Warp Prism ever be under fire while in Phasing Mode, they can quickly revert the Warp Prism back into Transport Mode for a quick retreat and relocation for additional deployments.\n\n- All units warping in under the Warp Prism's power field will be canceled if the Prism leaves Phasing Mode. The unit's costs will be 100% refunded, and the Warp Gates used will be instantly refreshed.\n\n## In Combination with Other Spells\n\nProtoss players can transport High Templars and use Psionic Storm to cripple, if not almost completely destroy, an enemy's mineral line in just a matter of seconds.\n\n## Notes", "question": "What happens to units that are warping in when the Warp Prism leaves Phasing Mode?", "options": ["They continue to warp in without interruption.", "They are instantly destroyed.", "Their warping in is canceled, and the costs are refunded.", "They are transported to the nearest Pylon."], "answer": "Their warping in is canceled, and the costs are refunded."}

These towers do not give direct sight of the main paths of attack (outlining the natural expansions and stemming from the main ramp), but rather reveal if anyone has the intention of taking the gold expansion found at opposing corners of the map (3/9 o'clock position).\n\n- Two more expansions are center at the neutral line that divides the two bases and blocked by destructible rocks (it is also where the xel'naga towers reside).", "question": "On the Cinder Fortress map, what is the purpose of the Xel'Naga towers?", "options": ["They provide direct sight of the main paths of attack.", "They reveal if anyone has the intention of taking the gold expansion found at opposing corners of the map.", "They serve as a defensive structure against enemy attacks.", "They are used to teleport units between the two bases."], "answer": "They reveal if anyone has the intention of taking the gold expansion found at opposing corners of the map."}

{"document": "# General ZvT Strategy\n## Scouting\n### Early-Game Scouting\n\nSince Terran will always wall their ramp it can sometimes be difficult to scout exactly what Terran is doing.  However, by using a combination of different scouting techniques, knowing common Terran TvZ builds, and using some educated guessing, you can usually be prepared for most builds.\n\n- Scouting the ramp - if you are unsure what Terran is doing, you should constantly scout your opponent's ramp by sending a Zergling up the ramp.  If Terran has any units at your opponent's ramp, you will be able to see them and respond accordingly\n\n- Knowing common openings - if your initial Drone scout sees 2 Barracks, you can being preparing for a 2 rax.  If your Drone scout sees a Rax-Refinery build, you can expect a Hellion expand build, or Hellions followed up with a Banshee Opening.\n\n- Sacrificing an Overlord - this tactic is one of the most important ways Zerg has of scouting Terran.  After Terran walls off their ramp, they can go for a non-standard build or an all-in, and you cannot see inside your opponent's base to know what your opponent is doing.  By flying an Overlord in, you have a chance of seeing the buildings inside the Terran base, thereby seeing what build your opponent is doing.  However, since Overlords are very slow, it is possible your Overlord may not see anything before being shot down by Marines.  The best time to send in an Overlord is between 5:30 - 6:00 game time, since Terran will have already committed to a build.  You must prepare for sacrificing an Overlord at the very beginning of the game, by sending your first Overlord towards your opponent.  This is the only way to be able to have an Overlord by your opponents base by the 5:30 - 6:00 mark.\n\nOftentimes, Terran will wall off their ramp, build their buildings away from the ramp, and keep only a Marine or two by the ramp, so that your Zergling scout does not see anything useful.  In addition, your opponent may keep Marines patrolling the edge of their base, to spot and shoot down your sacrificial Overlord before it can see anything.\n\nIn the event that all of your scouting attempts are denied, you'll have to make a decision:\n\n- guess at what your opponent is doing, and prepare for a specific build (or set of builds)\n\n- try and prepare for every type of build that your opponent might do\n\nKnowing your opponent, knowing what strategies the map favors, game sense, and map position can all play a part in helping you here.", "question": "What is the best time to send an Overlord into a walled Terran base to scout their build?", "options": ["0:30 - 1:00 game time", "2:30 - 3:00 game time", "5:30 - 6:00 game time", "8:30 - 9:00 game time"], "answer": "5:30 - 6:00 game time"}

{"document": "# Partin\n## Adaptation and build variations\n\nThe combination of a fast twilight council and robotics facility allow this same opening to branch out in several directions with only small adjustments. The most obvious one is, of course, infamous 7-gate blink all-in, but since it has already been discussed in a certain Great Book, everyone is probably familiar with it. Another way of going semi all-in with this blink opener is to delay the robo while constantly producing stalkers off three to four gates and committing to a straight up attack as you slowly saturate your natural expansion. However, this kind of attack is weaker than a full out blink all-in, which means you will still need to prepare the same three base colossus transition.\n\nNext up, ask yourself...what is one click away when you have a warp prism and twilight council? Yep...DT drops, hooray!\nPartinG has used two different builds off this same opener. The first one is a simple build where he does the same exact opening he would with the standard build but getting a dark shrine instead of blink. This is particularly strong on Overgrowth, where DTs can bypass a turret at the natural by warping in from a pylon at the third base. After the harassment phase, PartinG goes for a more standard two base colossus/blink style into a third base. This is the build order he used against Maru in their last GSL match:\n\n- Standard MSC expand/Twilight Council opener\n\n- Only build 2x Stalkers off the first Gate\n\n- Dark Shrine and second gate as soon as twilight council completes, sneak out a probe for Proxy Pylons\n\n- 6:30: Robotics, natural gasses as money allows; units off the robo: warp prism, 2-3 observers\n\n- 100% Dark Shrine: warp in DTs at your Proxy Pylons, send one to the main and one to the natural\n\n- Only warp in additional DTs if the opportunity is there. Prioritize killing SCVs over sniping add-ons unless you are sure the Terran won't have a scan in time.\n\n- ~8:30: Robotics Bay and Forge; play standard two base Colossus/Blink from here\n\nThe second build adds a DT drop on top of the blink stalker pressure, and is considerably less standard. In his match against TY, PartinG decided to still go fast third off this, but the investment into the DTs makes the nexus much harder to hold. If you choose this variation, be prepared to cancel it if a group of stimmed bio shows up. The build order is basically the standard blink/warp prism opening, but it delays the support bay and fast third nexus by about one minute in favor of starting a dark shrine together with blink and the warp prism.", "question": "In the context of PartinG's DT drop strategy, what is the recommended action if you notice a group of stimmed bio units approaching?", "options": ["A) Continue the DT drop regardless", "B) Cancel the DT drop and prepare for defense", "C) Focus on expanding to a third base", "D) Build more stalkers for an offensive push"], "answer": "B) Cancel the DT drop and prepare for defense"}

It harvests resources, has a low-powered melee attack, and can warp-in any Protoss building. All Protoss buildings other than a Pylon, Nexus, and Assimilator must be built within power range from a nearby Pylon or Warp Prism. Unlike its Terran and Zerg counterparts, the Probe does not have to remain in place to keep working on a building being warped in, and it instead can perform other tasks, such as warping in more buildings or returning to harvest resources.\n\nThe Probe's regenerating Plasma Shield sets apart the Probe from the SCV and Drone as well. Especially in the early stages of the game, shields play a very large role in the scouting and harassment abilities of the Probe, as a skilled player can avoid pursuing units (such as Zerglings or Marines) well enough that any damage to the shields will be quickly restored. Other common uses stemming from these attributes are delaying Hatchery or Spawning Pool placement and harassing building SCVs.\n\n## Abilities\n\nGather\nOrder workers or MULEs to gather resources from selected mineral field or vespene geyser.\n\nBuild Minerals: * Vespene Gas: *Duration: *Order worker to build/warp in/morph into a basic structure. *Cost and time vary depending on building.\n\nAdvanced Build Minerals: * Vespene Gas: *Duration: *Order worker to build/warp in/morph into an advanced structure. *Cost and time vary depending on building.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\n### General\n\nLike all worker units, Probes are often used to scout, harass, and gain control of Xel'Naga Towers. Probes are also frequently sent around the map to build \"proxy\" Pylons in key locations to give vision and enable reinforcements to warp in.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nProbes have a faster movement speed than the Zealot, meaning that (if skillfully maneuvered) they can continue scouting the opponent's base in the early game until a Cybernetics Core and a unit with a ranged attack (a Stalker or Sentry) are warped in.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nThe initial scouting Probe is often used for attacking SCVs as they construct Terran buildings, and can harass further by blocking building/add-on placement. Harassing SCVs that attempt to construct buildings can force the Terran to pull additional workers to defend the building SCV, further reducing the Terran's mining rate. The Probe is free to attack the helpless SCV before additional workers can arrive to repel it. Due to its shields, the Probe can withstand a few attacks from reinforcing SCVs, and retreat to safety when its shields run low. As the Probe flees to regenerate its shields, the Terran has to swap the damaged SCV with a new one. When the Probe reaches full shields again, it can resume harassment. At its best, this will result in several wounded SCVs before the first Marine comes out.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe initial scouting Probe is often used to delay an early Zerg expansion, either by warping in a Pylon to block the Hatchery from being placed at the optimal position, or by dancing around the location to prevent the Drone from building in the necessary position. These techniques are often combined to further delay the Zerg's expansion, by planting a Pylon after dancing with the Probe.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Probe is the standard unit which is used to determine time and/or distance between bases when describing a map.\n\n## External links\n\n- Probe's quotes (video and sound) - YouTube video.", "question": "Which of the following abilities allows a Probe to warp in Protoss structures without needing to remain stationary?", "options": ["Gather", "Advanced Build", "Build", "None of the above"], "answer": "Build"}
{"document": "# General ZvZ Strategy\n## Unit Roles and Counters\n\n- Zerglings: The main attack force early on, the amount and timing of Zerglings made largely defines a players opening. They can be produced early and in large numbers to try and end the game, or in lower numbers for scouting or to delay your opponent's attacks until Roaches are available.\n\n- Roaches: Due to the lack of a cost effective hard counter, as well as their relatively high HP and decent damage output, Roaches are the bread & butter unit for both defense and offense in most Zerg versus Zerg strategies.\n\n- Banelings: Used commonly in conjunction with zerglings for aggressive play, usually in the early game. They are the hard counter to Zerglings and as such are the main choice against armies which consist of a large amount of Zerglings. If using mutalisks, they can also be used as a viable option in the mid game army in conjunction with centrifugal hooks to take out enemy hydralisks that are a threat to your mutalisks\n\n- Hydralisks: A high DPS midgame support and anti-air unit used to back up roaches or defend against Mutalisks. Due to their low mobility and relatively low HP, Hydralisks are very vulnerable unless they are supported by other units, such as Roaches.\n\n- Mutalisks: A high mobility unit used for drone harass and Overlord-hunting in the midgame. Low numbers of them are relatively weak in open combat, but larger flocks are a great danger to any unprepared opponent.\n\n- Infestors: Vulnerable caster unit which can move while burrowed. Mainly used as a support unit in Roach-based compositions. Their Fungal Growth spell can shift the tide of larger battles if used properly.\n\n- Corruptors: Support unit against Mutalisk-based unit compositions. Otherwise rarely used.\n\n- Brood Lords: Slow, but high-damage air siege unit. Rarely seen in ZvZ due to their late position in the Zerg tech tree. Very good against Roach/Hydra/Infestor armies if the game gets to that stage.\n\n- Ultralisks: High HP and high damage ground unit.

{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Execution\n### Adaptations\n#### Fast 3 Hatch Expand\n\nA fast 3rd for Zerg is typically placed at around 9 minutes (or earlier) either before or immediately after Spire. However, doing so results in the Zerg having a relatively weak ground force and low tech at around 10–11 minutes just as the 3rd is stabilizing. To exploit this weakness, the best counter is to mass Marines and some Marauders as soon as possible. You want to start combat shields and stim pack research as soon as you spot the 3rd going down.

Chances are that any building not used for building Tech Lab units ends up with a Reactor sooner or later.\n\nExchanging the building attached to a Reactor using lift off is a frequent occurrence. For one, it is useful for tech switching.\nFurther, less important production buildings, such as perhaps a Factory in a bio-heavy build, can accelerate unit production by building add-ons for the more important buildings.\nIn particular in the early game, many builds aim for the mass production of certain Factory or Starport units as soon as possible.\n\n## Notes\n\n- The two units being built simultaneously using a Reactor are independent and do not need to be of the same kind nor start or finish at the same time.\n\n- When a Reactor is destroyed while multiple units are building ...\nThe construction of the first unit in the queue will proceed regularly, but the second unit will cease making progress.

Other resources are harder to protect.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Each team spawning NW and SE of each other, sharing two main chokes for ground based assaults allowing teams to easily wall in.\n\n- The two accessible expansions have destructible rocks, making them somewhat less lucrative for early expansions but much easier to defend than the expansions directly outside of the base.\n\n- These two expansions are very close to each-other, and if a Zerg teammate takes one of these expansions, the creep will make the nearby expo unavailable to both Terran and Protoss players unless it is built before the creep extends that far.\n\n- There are a total of ten (10) Xel'Naga watch towers on this map, two sets of three are in each base, two towers directly opposite both east and west of the center assault lane, and two more on the far SW and NE expansions guarded by destructible rocks.\n\n- There are two gold expansions, but they are easily accessible via the northern or southern ground attack lanes respectively and do not have any vespene geysers.\n\n- Additional expansions can be found adjacent of the left ramp near the watchtowers as well as two more at the 2/8 o'clock position pinched between two destructible rocked entrances\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe elevated platforms at the 8'o'clock and the 2'o'clock of each team's choke points are excellent locations for proxies and drops. Very few players routinely scout out each platform, opting to take control of the central Xel'Naga watch tower.\n\nIf you are in the central base on either side, make sure you scout the expansion behind you. Protoss players can rush a pylon and several cannons here that will be out of your sight; once they move their probe up into your base for vision, all of your workers / mineral line will be in range.", "question": "On the Arakan Citadel map, which of the following is true regarding the two accessible expansions?", "options": ["They are protected by indestructible rocks, making them highly lucrative for early expansions.", "They are far from each other, making it difficult for allies to defend them.", "They are close to each other, and if a Zerg teammate takes one, the creep will affect nearby expansions for Terran and Protoss players.", "They are guarded by Xel'Naga watch towers, providing additional resources."], "answer": "They are close to each other, and if a Zerg teammate takes one, the creep will affect nearby expansions for Terran and Protoss players."}

{"document": "# Gate Nexus YufFE (vs. Zerg)\n## Execution\n### Adaptation\n\nThere are two common Zerg reactions to a fast expansion build like this one: an aggressive push or heavy economic focus. If scouting shows the Zerg staying on one base, expect an early push and build countermeasures, like Cannons, Zealots for Speedlings and Stalkers counter Roaches. Just stay alive, you have a better income.\n\n\"All-ins\" from a 2-Base-Zerg are dangerous, too. E. g. Roach-Speedling-All-In around the 7:30-minute-mark. You want to have either:\n\n- at least two Sentries, a Void Ray out and 3-4 Gateways (wall) plus at least three Cannons\n\n- at least two Sentries, Immortal out and some 3-4 Gateways (wall) plus at least three Cannons\n\n- at least one Sentry out, six Gateways and a \"warp-in\" ready (chronoboosted a lot) plus at least three Cannons\n\nPriority is to stay alive and lose as few Probes as possible. It's okay to build more Cannons for that purpose. To hit this timings, Zerg has to skip drones and stay on Tier 1 for a very long time, so you are ahead after his attack.\n\nAttacking with two Zealots is advised, if you scout an early expansion Hatchery. E. g. a Zerg plays \"Hatch First\". Often he builds a lot of Drones and less troops. If you attack early with two Zealots you force him to build Zerglings or Spine Crawler or both. In lower leagues you often can kill Drones or even a Queen.\n\nMost Zergs expand again, with a third hatch within five minutes. You have to scout for expansions, Tech, and unit compositions to react properly. If the Zerg player takes a third Hatchery before the 5 minute mark your 2 Zealots can be used to harass the third Hatchery. This forces reactive Zerglings or the loss of the expansion.\n\nIn either case, the most important piece of scouting information is the expansion Hatchery.", "question": "What is the advised action when you scout an early expansion Hatchery in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Build more Cannons", "Attack with two Zealots", "Expand your own base immediately", "Build a Void Ray"], "answer": "Attack with two Zealots"}
{"document": "# Archon (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### General\n\nArchons primarily function as support units. Because they have a range of 3, Archons can sit safely behind a line of Zealots and deal damage to the enemy forces without taking much damage. Because Protoss shields regenerate rapidly out of combat, Archons are much more effective if they pull out of battle before they die.\n\nArchons cannot be commanded as they merge, but they can be bumped around like big psionic soccer balls by moving units into them. Morphing Archons can be moved behind the army as protection, or taken to retreat with the rest of the army.\n\nArchons are often used as part of or against a timing push. They are a Protoss player's quickest access to area of effect damage. The Colossi and High Templar require some time to reach their potential. Colossi require a Robotics Bay in addition to the Colossus itself, whereas a High Templar's Psionic Storm costs 75 energy and must be researched.\n\nArchons are massive units; ergo, they crush Force Fields on contact. This makes them especially useful in PvP timing pushes because many players rely on Force Fields for defense.\n\nPlayers often merge Archons when High Templar run out of energy in the field, or if the opponent has detectors that vitiate the Dark Templars' main strength.\n\nThe warp in cost of an Archon from two High Templars is 100/300, and the cost from two Dark Templars is 250/250. The cost of merging an Archon from one of each is consequently 175/275. Gas is a more \"precious\" resource within StarCraft II because it is used for teching and upgrades; therefore, it may be better to warp in Dark Templar to make Archons. However, the Protoss may use High Templar to save minerals for building chargelots, since chargelots are powerful when paired with archons. This may be especially useful to follow a DT Fast Expand, as the saved gas allows for a faster transition into a more \"standard\" method of play.", "question": "What is a strategic advantage of using Archons in StarCraft II battles?", "options": ["They can be commanded as they merge.", "They can regenerate shields rapidly during combat.", "They can crush Force Fields on contact.", "They require a Robotics Bay to be produced."], "answer": "They can crush Force Fields on contact."}

{"document": "# Stalker (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### General\n\nThe Stalker is a key component of early ground armies due to its ranged damage, speed, ability to counter air units, and early access to an attack bonus towards armored units (such as Marauders and Roaches). In Legacy of the Void, it is overall a very flexible unit. However, Stalkers are relatively gas inefficient units, particularly as an armored unit because this makes them weak to Marauders and Immortals, and Stalkers may get phased out towards the end game as more specialised units are unlocked in the tech tree.\n\nBlink extends the flexibility of this unit in the midgame. Blink Stalkers can evade established defensive positions or abuse cliffs to get away from any pursuers. Against highly mobile harassment such as upgraded Reapers or Mutalisks, jumping in to engage with the Blink upgrade can help secure kills.\n\nIn LotV the Adept is another ranged option at the Gateway. It fills a similar role to the Stalker, as a fast and ranged unit with a movement micro ability, but is more tuned towards the early game as its Psionic Transfer (\"Shade\") movement ability comes pre-unlocked and it costs less gas than the Stalker. The Stalker is more favoured in the midgame it has higher stats and more general flexibility.

They can be used to pick off Zerg Overlords as well as use their Graviton Beam ability to pick up and kill workers. Their fast movement speed allows them to fall back before taking significant damage.\n\n- High Templar and Colossus drops with the use of a Warp Prism are also commonly used to kill enemy workers because of their splash damage.\n\n- Dark Templars can annihilate an entire mineral line worth of workers in seconds if the opposing player does not notice them in time or lacks detection.\n\n- Zealots can be sent into the opponents mineral line in a small group to kill workers and delay mining. This only works when the opponent has their army out of position and is therefore best used in the lategame when your opponent is more spread out, when the opponent is attacking you or when you are being contained.\n\n- Oracles have brought a new form of Protoss harassment in HotS, using their fast movement speeds and energy based Activate Pulsar Beam to quickly tear through enemy worker lines.\n\n- Adepts can quickly kill workers and other light units and move between different bases with their Psionic Transfer.", "question": "Which Protoss unit can effectively pick off Zerg Overlords and use the Graviton Beam ability to kill workers?", "options": ["Void Ray", "Phoenix", "High Templar", "Dark Templar"], "answer": "Phoenix"}

{"document": "# Plasma Shield\n\nThe Plasma Shield mechanic is a permanent, passive attribute of all Protoss units and buildings.  It provides a supplementary source of hit points which must be removed before any damage is done to the standard hit point pool.

Shields apply their own armor stat (which starts at 0) independent of the unit or building's standard armor which reduces damage to hit points.  Shield armor can be improved by 3 levels of upgrades via the Forge, similar to normal armor, but it is a separate upgrade, and applies to all units and buildings.\n\n## Other\n\n- Shields begin to recharge after 10 game seconds have passed.

For example a Marauder deals the full 20 damage to the shields of a Stalker, but only 10 to the shields of a Zealot.\n\n## Interaction with Other Units\n\n- The Terran Ghost's EMP Round does 100 points of damage to shields, but unlike an attack overflow is not removed from hit points.

{"document": "# 4 Gate Blink Obs All-In (vs. Terran)\n## Execution\n\nIn terms of execution, what you want to be doing is making sure that you're dealing damage whilst simultaneously making sure that you're unlikely to take damage to your Stalkers. For example, running right behind the enemy's mineral line in an attempt to kill SCVs is usually a bad idea as your Stalkers will get flanked by units on one side and SCVs on the other. Basically, try to make sure you always have a clear path to a cliff-edge so that you can escape if you need to.\n\nSecondly, you shouldn't use Blink micro within the enemy's base, you should instead kite your enemy's units back to the cliff-edge and use Blink micro to get weakened Stalkers out of the base. Once all your Stalkers are down the cliff, immediately attack the natural expansion and target fire any Bunkers that might be there, and when the enemy shows up to defend their natural Blink back into their main base.\n\nAnother important thing is not to move your Observer(s) too close to the enemy's cliff-edge. They only need to be close enough to give you vision. If they get sniped by the opponent then your attack is going to be significantly weakened until another Observer arrives, and that could give the opponent enough time to set-up adequate defences at both their main and natural.\n\nLast of all, there is one important target that you should always be looking for when using this build, and that's the Tech-Lab researching Stim. If you can snipe Stim Research then it's going to be very hard for the Terran to deal with your harassment as you shouldn't really lose many Stalkers to Marines and Marauders without Stim.", "question": "When executing a 4 Gate Blink Obs All-In against a Terran player, what is the recommended action if your Stalkers are weakened?", "options": ["Run behind the enemy's mineral line to kill SCVs", "Use Blink micro to escape the base and regroup", "Attack the natural expansion immediately without consideration", "Stay in the enemy base and continue fighting"], "answer": "Use Blink micro to escape the base and regroup"}

{"document": "# 2 Gate Fast Expand (vs. Protoss)\n## FAQs\n\nWhat do I do if I scout a proxy 2 Gate? Will the Sentry be out in time?\nIf you scout a proxy 2 Gate, drop your Sentry first opening and defend appropriately.\n\nHow does this build fare against Zealot/Stalker pokes?\nThis build gets a Sentry and 2 Stalkers out at 5:30, the normal timing for a standard poke, so you should be able to deflect it without any trouble.\n\nAfter early Gateway pressure, I get contained on one base and can't get out. What do I do?\nThe most common response is to make a Warp Prism from your Robo and drop a few Zealots while pushing down your ramp. If you managed to get a Pylon out on the map, you can also do a Zealot warp-in to harass the opponent's mineral line.\n\nIs it possible to substitute a Stargate for the Robo? What about going Blink or Dark Templar?\nThese timings are a little less solid and Stargate play takes greater multi-tasking ability. You should not go Blink or Dark Templar to follow up this expand, primarily because you won't have detection and you don't get a solid scout until 6:00. If you try to skip detection with this build, you will 100% lose to early Dark Templar.\n\nI keep dying to certain all-ins like 10 Gate Into 3 Gate, Void Ray All-Ins, proxy 2 Gate Stalker Rushes etc. Am I doing something wrong?\nHonestly, these are all very difficult builds to stop even in the most ideal situations. Unless you're already opening with a 3 Stalker rush, these cheeses are very difficult to hold. Fortunately, this build is the closest thing to a 3 Stalker rush so it shouldn't be a build order loss; you just need to micro very well in order to win.\n\nHow is this build better than a 1 Gate FE?\nThis build gets a lot of Gateway units out early to deal with any potential threats while a 1 Gate FE focuses on getting a very early Nexus so that Photon Overcharge can be used to deflect early pressure. The 2 Gate expand therefore has a more mobile defense that provides a lot of flexibility to adapt to your opponent's build and react accordingly, allowing you to play more safely compared to a 1 Gate expand. This build, for instance, can blindly hold proxy Stargates and Blink Stalker all-ins and doesn't have to blindly build an Immortal after expanding. The keyword here is safety.\n\nOf course, the heavy Gateway count and later Nexus of a 2 Gate expand result in a less economic opening with a later Nexus and later tech. However, the focus on heavy Gateway units and good flow on information allows you to compete with the more economic 1 Gate FE by using 3 Gate timing-attacks and faster Forges to pull ahead.\n\nWhile 1 Gate FEs can deflect 3 Gate pressure with a finished Nexus and Photon Overcharge, the 2 Gate expand has weaknesses to 3 Gate pressure builds before the Nexus has finished (~7:30). In these situations, it's usually mandatory to cancel the Nexus, defend on one base, and play from behind. However, the emphasis on early Gateway units allows you to harass and push down your ramp fairly early to break even again. During this time, you can generally get a strong read on your opponent through Hallucination and Observers.\n\nThe point of this build is to develop a stable defense while taking an early non-committal expansion. Simply put, in situations where 1 Gate FEs would die, this build would only be playing from behind. Because of this, the 2 Gate expand is a great ladder build because of it's ability to defend almost anything with only minor adjustments.\n\nIs this build map dependent?\nThis build has the potential to do well on any map, but works best on maps with small chokes at the natural and manageable cliffs such as Frost or Habitation Station. This is primarily due to the build's reliance on Force Fields and wall-offs to deal with certain all-ins. This build does not do well on maps with large surface areas to Blink into the main such as Yeonsu or Heavy Rain.\n\nI'm learning builds for a BoX series. Would you say this is a good build to add?", "question": "What is the primary advantage of the 2 Gate Fast Expand build over a 1 Gate FE in terms of defense?", "options": ["It allows for faster economic expansion with an earlier Nexus.", "It focuses on getting an early Photon Overcharge to deflect early pressure.", "It provides a more mobile defense with early Gateway units to adapt to threats.", "It emphasizes the construction of a Stargate for air superiority."], "answer": "It provides a more mobile defense with early Gateway units to adapt to threats."}
{"document": "# Macro\n## Planning\n\nLearning where and when to spend your resources is a fundamental part of StarCraft II. In order to be quick and concise about building your base and army, you need to plan ahead. In order to plan ahead you need a goal. For example, if your goal is to get a Siege Tank, you will need a Barracks, Gas and a Factory with a Tech Lab. Having made this plan beforehand allows you to plan ahead on what buildings to build.\n\nA build order is the optimal way of reaching a goal. They are often thought-out beforehand so that perfect execution will get you to your goal in the best way possible.\n\n| A simple example |\n| --- |\n| Scenario: Playing Terran, in order to invest in Eco, you set your goal as: constant SCV production. , In this case, the optimal time to get a Supply Depot is when you have 10 SCVs. This way it will be finished once you reach 11/11 SCVs.; You don't have any minerals to make the Supply Depot any earlier, but delaying it will leave you will too little Supply to keep making SCVs. Building a Supply Depot at 10 therefore is the optimal way to enable constant SCV production. |\n\nYou don't have any minerals to make the Supply Depot any earlier, but delaying it will leave you will too little Supply to keep making SCVs.

{"document": "# Kcdc's 1 Gate FE (vs. Terran)\n## Scouting\n### Scenario 1: The Oppoent Goes For A Gasless Opening\n\nWhen your Robotics Facility finishes, build an Observer and then a Warp Prism. The Warp Prism is there to distract your opponent's focus so that you can get Psionic Storms off on their main army before he EMPs them. Ideally, your army at 12-14 minutes should be out on the map threatening to attack their natural expansion before the Warp Prism hits the field (try sneaking a few Zealots around to his third mineral line to pull his troops out of position and distract his focus), but the Warp Prism will be really helpful in dragging the Terran out of position. Put 1 High Templar and 1 Probe in the Warp Prism so that you can Storm their main mineral line whilst also building Pylons in their main base to keep them distracted whilst you attack either their natural expansion or their third base.\n\nThis part of the game will feel hectic. You'll often find yourself dropping their main base, attacking his third base or fighting over a watch tower, and defending your bases from drops all at the same time. Whilst you're doing all of this, make sure to start +2 Weapons, +3 Armour and +3 Weapons on time. It's very easy to forget to keep upgrading and to forget to keep chrono Boosting upgrades, so do not be afraid to queue them up ahead of time. It's bad to queue, but it's worse to not upgrade.\n\nAfter starting +2 Weapons, you'll want to think about taking a fourth base and adding a Robotics Support Bay for Colossus. The timing on the Support Bay will depend on the game. In general, it will come while +2 Weapons is researching and at about the same time that you take your 4th base. if your opponent has a lot of Ghosts and you cannot get much done with High Templar, get Colossi before your 4th base. If your fights are going well and you're thinning out his Ghost count, you can delay Colossi to take a fourth whilst you punish his low Ghost count with Zealot/Archon/Templar.\n\nFor the Colossus transition, I do not recommend waiting until you see too many Ghosts before making a 180 degree turn to double Robo Colossus. A smoother transition with single Robo Colossus production while you're still doing decently well with Zealot/Archon/Templar is much more effective. That way, you'll find that you have 2 Colossi sitting at home when you need to defend a big push, or you'll bring those 2 Colossi to the front at just the right time to tip the scales for the last fight. Try to keep your Colossi hidden for as long as possible so that you do not trigger the Terran to build Vikings.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of the Warp Prism in Kcdc's 1 Gate FE strategy against Terran with a gasless opening?", "options": ["To distract the opponent and allow for Psionic Storms to be effective", "To block the opponent's supply line", "To scout the opponent's base", "To provide a mobile base for building structures"], "answer": "To distract the opponent and allow for Psionic Storms to be effective"}

{"document": "# Hydralisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\n- Against Protoss, Hydralisks may be considered one of the best counters to Gateway units (particularly the problematic Sentry) and the damage they inflict is especially effective against Stalker and Zealots.\n\n- Moreover, with enough upgrade spending, Hydralisks can even trade with Void Rays almost 1 to 1.  However, the damage itself is outweighed by the Zerg being attrition-based race, so late game Hydralisks still remain glass cannons - while retaining their effective damage, their health and armor is found lacking when facing a Protoss deathball or lots of AoE.\n\nThat being said, while Hydralisks' main weakness is their vulnerability to AoE, the Protoss are severely lacking in that regard. Hence, when in army versus army combat, be on alert for enemy Disruptors or High Templars, and, if you note their presence, stay on the widest ground possible, as their AoE can only work if they can get you trapped in a narrow path (and remember - narrow for Zerg is not the same as narrow for Protoss or Terran). Colossi is another threat you have to be cautious about. While seemingly undangerous units when facing a horde of Hydralisks, the combination of Colossi and Sentries does pose a lot of danger. Sentries will wall your Hydras off, while Colossi with a range upgrade will burn your army down. The relatively obvious solution to the aforementioned is using either a few Vipers and their Abduct or a few Infestors with Neural Parasite upgrade. Once the target is pulled in, it must be focused down, wherever it's abducted or mind-controlled.\n\nObvious uses for Hydralisks in ZvP include using them as a backbone AA unit (as their burst makes short work of Carriers' Interceptors), or playing Hydralisk rush, with topping the rush with Lurkers, Overseers and Vipers. Do note, however, that \"Golden Armada\" of Carriers is barely stoppable by Hydralisks alone, so you either have to end the ZvP game fast or not consider the latter strategy at all.", "question": "What is a key strategy to counter the combination of Colossi and Sentries when facing them with Hydralisks in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Use a few Vipers with Abduct or Infestors with Neural Parasite upgrade.", "Focus on upgrading Hydralisks' armor to withstand Colossi's attacks.", "Build more Hydralisks to overwhelm the enemy army.", "Deploy additional Mutalisks to attack from the air."], "answer": "Use a few Vipers with Abduct or Infestors with Neural Parasite upgrade."}

It takes 7 Banelings (350  Minerals: / 175  Vespene Gas:) to kill a Bunker and the remaining Marines (300  Minerals:). The following techniques can make your life much easier.\n\n- Delay your 4th CC until you have secured your natural with at least 2 Bunkers.\n\n- The raxes you build after you finish your 3rd CC should used as part of the wall at your natural.\n\n- Put up 4-5 Bunkers and spread them out at your natural, the trick is to put only 1-2 Marines in each Bunker. This makes your natural extremely difficult to bust. Once your natural has been secured, salvage the extraneous Bunkers.\n\n- Any remaining Marines should be kept completely isolated from other Marines. IE. They should be spread out completely such that any given Baneling will hit only 1 or 2 Marines. This spreading is done at around 7:00 minutes and before the Banelings come knocking.\n\n- You can use your 3rd CC to simcity and help you wall-off your natural. Only do this if you are certain you are faced with a Baneling bust and not a Roach Baneling bust.\n\nDepending on the amount of pressure exerted by the Zerg, and if he didn't completely all-in, your opponent will likely transition either to sling/bling/muta or sling/bling/Infestor while trying to secure a 3rd.

{"document": "# Archon toilet\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Archon Toilet refers to a Protoss tactic unique to Wings of Liberty that combines the Mothership's Vortex ability with the Archon's high splash damage output to destroy large groups of enemy units quickly.\n\nThe effectiveness of this tactic was significantly reduced in Patch 1.3.0, which made units leaving the Vortex invulnerable for 1.5 seconds. Even so, it remained a vital tactic against Broodlord-based lategame Zerg armies until the release of Heart of the Swarm, where the Vortex ability was removed completely and replaced by Time Warp.\n\n## Execution\n\nWhen engaging a large opposing force with the support of a Mothership and Archons, cast Vortex in the middle of the largest group to \"flush\" the group into the Vortex.  Then order your Archons to move into the Vortex as well.  Upon the dissipation of the Vortex, the Archons will attack at once and the resulting splash damage will likely destroy all enemy units hit. High Templars with Psionic Storm can also be used in lieu of or in addition to Archons.\n\n## Famous Uses\n\n- Squirtle Vs. Mvp - 2012 GSL Season 2 Code S Final, Game 5 (Metropolis) (GOMTV YouTube VOD). Unique both because it came in a GSL Code S final and because it was used to take down a large fleet of Battlecruisers.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Terran\n## The Late Game\n\nCurrently, I would like to dissuade you from going for a purely Ultralisk composition. While it can be very effective to go for Ultralisks, then switch to Brood Lords, it is usually not effective to stick to Ultralisks as the game goes on and on (unless you have a big lead, then it really doesn't matter what you do). In general, the most optimal late game composition in this match-up looks like:\n\n- 6-8 Brood Lords\n\n- ~10 Infestors\n\n- 6-8 Queens\n\n- Rest Corruptor/Zergling\n\nKeep in mind that you don't need as many Brood Lords in ZvT as you do in ZvP. The main threat to your Brood Lords are Vikings. Tank splash from the Tanks attacking Broodlings combined with Fungal Growth takes care of the threat of Marines easily (the Marines will be held back by the Fungals, not able to get to the Brood Lords as quickly as Stalkers can). When your Brood Lords get low on health, remember to use the Queen's Transfuse ability to heal them back up. Be sure not to let your Brood Lords or Infestors be caught out in the open, as this is how most players will lose their games. The other major threat is drop play - make sure you have 10-15 Zerglings and 2-4 Banelings supplemented by Spine and Spore Crawlers at each of your outlying bases. Remember to carefully watch for dropships that run past these defenses to an inner base that may not be as well protected (Spore Crawlers and leaving one Infestor should be sufficient to handle this threat). Other than that - focus your Fungals on clumps of units, being careful not to waste all of your energy on Infested Terrans, and don't rush into anything you're unsure about - take the late game slowly.", "question": "Which unit is primarily used to heal Brood Lords in Zerg vs. Terran late game?", "options": ["Infestors", "Queens", "Ultralisks", "Corruptors"], "answer": "Queens"}

On an equal supply basis, Vikings will be able to take out Void Rays and without micro will go relatively even against Phoenices and Carriers.\n\nVikings are primarily used to kill Colossi. The approximate number of Vikings to build depends on the number of Colossi your opponent has, although it is also viable to get enough Vikings to take down Colossi in X number of shots.\n\nAssuming no upgrades, Vikings deal 10 (+4 armored) x2 damage to air per attack. Therefore it takes 5 attacks to almost deplete their shields (140 damage). After that they deal 13 x2 damage to the hull per attack (Colossi have 1 base armor). 6 attacks will deplete their shields and deal 16 damage to the hull. After that it takes 8 shots to deplete their hull health (184 remaining, 26 damage per shot), for a total of 14 shots.\n\nTo 3-shot Colossi, therefore, you need 5 Vikings; to 2-shot them, you need 7; to 1-shot them, you need 14.", "question": "How many Vikings are required to 2-shot a Colossus without any upgrades?", "options": ["5", "7", "9", "14"], "answer": "7"}

{"document": "# Queen (Legacy of the Void)\n## Spells\n\nSpawn Larva\nCaster: Queen 25\nRange: 1\nCooldown: 1.8\nDuration: 29 s\nThe Queen injects 3 Larva eggs into a Hatchery which after 29 seconds, hatch and 3 Larvae are ready to be used at the targeted Hatchery. If a Hatchery has more than 19 Larva, additional Larva will not be created.  This will stack and queue if the target is already spawning additional larvae.\n\nSpawn Larva is the most powerful ability at the Queen's disposal. At every possible chance, the Queen's energy should be used to spawn additional Larva at a particular Hatchery. One Queen will recover enough energy to constantly spawn Larva at one Hatchery. This ability increases the capacity of Zerg to produce any type of unit. As a general rule of thumb, each base the Zerg obtains can support one Hatchery with a Queen and its Spawn Larva ability. There is a limit of 19 Larvae per Hatchery; any extras spawned will cause Larvae to die, bringing the count back to 19.\n\nSpawn Creep Tumor\nCaster: Queen, Creep Tumor 25\nRange: 1\nDuration: 11 s\nThe Queen moves to and places a Creep Tumor at the targeted location. The tumor has 50 hit points and generates Creep. Each Creep Tumor can spawn one other Creep Tumor within a radius of 10.\n\nThe Spawn Creep Tumor is a less prioritized ability of the Queen, as Spawn Larva is a more essential ability, but it is still a commonly used and powerful ability. Creep Tumors allow Zerg players to extend their creep, which can be used to create creep 'bridges' between expansions for faster reinforcements, to spread creep on key areas of the map that might require Zerg to be more mobile, or to bring Spine or Spore Crawlers to a more forward position. This ability can be used in place of the Overlord's Generate Creep ability.\n\nTumors allow Zerg players to creep up their entire side of the map without the risk of exposing Overlords to fire. Another benefit of this ability is that once a tumor is placed, it can spread itself indefinitely by creating new tumors around the map, assuming the 'live' one is not killed. Once the tumor is created, it becomes burrowed, gives large vision radius and spreading more creep.\n\nFor faster creep spreading via tumors, you can create multiple tumors, or use Overlords to generate creep at the maximum range of the tumor so that you do not need to wait for the creep to spread normally.\n\nTransfusion\nCaster: Queen 50\nRange: 7\nCooldown: 1 s\nInstantly heals a target friendly, biological unit or structure for 75 health. An additional 50 health regenerates over 7 seconds. Can only be used on Creep.\n\nTransfusion is the least used ability of the Queen. Because all Queens are generally below 25 energy due to constant usage of Spawn Larva, Queens usually don't have the energy for Transfusion. However, Transfusion can be useful for units with high hit points such as a Brood Lord, an Ultralisk, or on occasion another Queen, as well as saving buildings that are low on health. Using Transfusion on buildings is particularly useful, because although structures regenerate health at the same rate as Zerg units, their greater HP means that structures take much longer to recover to full health.\n\nMultiple applications of Transfusion in rapid succession each heal for 75 health, but the 50 health over time effect does not stack, i.e., will be applied only once.", "question": "What is the maximum number of Larvae that can be present in a single Hatchery before additional Larvae will not be created?", "options": ["15", "19", "25", "30"], "answer": "19"}

Zealots with this ability will instantly Charge the enemy they are attacking so that they can engage in combat much faster.\n\nCharge temporarily increases the movement speed to 9.1, allowing Zealots to intercept nearby enemies. Charge also increases the base movement speed of Zealots to 4.72. With Charge a Zealot is faster than a Stalker.\n\nA Zealot with researched Charge is often named a \"Speedlot\" or \"Chargelot\".\n\n## Use\n\nThis ability can be incredibly useful for the Zealot as it is a melee attacking unit, and a relatively slow one at that. Charge tones down some of these disadvantages, ensuring that more Zealots will engage the enemy before being weakened or gunned down by enemy ranged attackers.\n\nThe ability has a range of 4, meaning that an enemy unit can only be Charged when the Zealot is attacking an enemy within that range. In other words, you can't be charging across the map like a stimmed Marine. However, once Charge is engaged, retargetting to a more distant target will allow the Zealot to Charge over a much larger distance as the ability will remain active for a short time or until a target is attacked. Use of this can enable Chargelots to envelope groups of enemies when used properly.\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ Blizzard Entertainment (22 November 2016). \"Legacy of the Void - Patch 3.8.0 -- November 22, 2016\".

{"document": "# Zerg\n\nThe Zerg are a race entirely unlike the Terrans or the Protoss. They are composed of many different species integrated into the Swarm via Zerg infestation. These creatures are rapidly and selectively evolved into deadly and efficient killers to further the driving Zerg imperative of achieving absolute domination. The Zerg make no use of technology to create their weapons, armor, or starships. Instead, these functions are efficiently fulfilled through biological adaptation and planned mutation of the Zerg strains. Even Zerg buildings are in fact specialized organs within the living, growing organism of a Zerg nest.\n\nWhen the Zerg first arrived in the Koprulu sector, they were unified by their absolute obedience to the Zerg collective sentience known as the Overmind. The Overmind ultimately directed the actions of every Zerg creature in the Swarm, functioning through a hierarchy of lesser sentiences. The first and most important tier of these consisted of the Cerebrates, each entrusted with direct control of a sizable section of the Swarm. The cerebrates' commands were disseminated in turn by the Overlords, which directly ordered and controlled the mass of Zerg creatures both in their nests and on the battlefield.\n\nAlthough the Overmind was primarily driven by its desire to consume and assimilate the advanced Protoss race, it found useful but undeveloped material in humanity. Taking a powerful psionic Terran, Sarah Kerrigan, the Overmind evolved a new and unique creature: the Queen of Blades. When the Protoss destroyed the Overmind during the invasion of Aiur, the Queen of Blades manipulated the Dark Templar into eliminating the surviving cerebrates. As a result, she came to dominate the Swarm.\n\n## Attributes\n\n- All units and buildings are biological and regenerate hit points over time\n\n- Cheap units built in quantity\n\n- Flexible because the Hatchery is the only production building\n\n- Drones sacrifice themselves to become buildings\n\n- Buildings must be built on creep\n\n- Speed advantage on creep\n\n## Stats\n\n- Zerg Units\n\n- Zerg Building Statistics\n\n- Zerg Tech Tree\n\n- Zerg Strategy", "question": "Which of the following is a unique attribute of Zerg buildings in StarCraft II?", "options": ["They are built using minerals and gas only", "They are mechanical and can be repaired with MULEs", "They must be built on creep", "They can be built anywhere on the map"], "answer": "They must be built on creep"}

Players generally don't make more than one Medivac as it doesn't have the dual-functionality it does with an infantry-based army, which Medivacs can heal.\n\n- Banshee: If you have the superior Viking count, a few Banshees can be used to push your opponent's Siege Tank lines back unless he has a Thor or Missile Turrets defending them.\n\n- Battlecruiser: Generally the unit that you get in the late-game if neither player can gain a sufficient advantage with the mid-game mech battles. Battlecruisers can kill or at the very least push back Siege Tank lines just like Banshees can, but are much less vulnerable to Thors and Missile Turrets. The only real response to Battlecruisers are Vikings as Thors do too little damage while Missile Turrets and Marines can be dealt with, especially with Siege Tank support.\n\n- Raven: Getting a Raven early on can be extremely useful as it will allow you to detect any cloaked Banshees and harass with Auto-Turrets, but most importantly, Point Defense Drone can help you in Viking-versus-Viking battles, and will help a lot if your opponent is going for a Marauder-heavy unit composition.

I like to place a Creep Tumor at my natural immediately with my next 25 energy - skipping inject #2 on that Queen. The extra creep spread means that you can spread creep out to around the middle of the map by the time any kind of 2 base all-in would hit and all the way to your opponent's fourth by the time a 3 base all-in would hit.\n\n- It is worthwhile to get one extra Queen as you are taking your fourth base to spread creep.

Throughout the entire game Hellions will also be expendable as the unit serves no other purpose than harassing the opponent's mineral lines and countering high Light attributed unit counts.\n\n- Thor: The health of the unit and damage output makes it a strong unit for standing at the front of the battle and taking the firepower head on. By the time a Thor has been taken down the damage dealt to the opponent's army will be much greater as long as Siege Tanks or additional Thors are also firing. Thors are generally most effective in mech-versus-mech battles, as its large size will negate a lot of the Siege Tank splash damage.

Producing these units is not optional as the opponent can abuse the poor mobility of Mechanical units with Banshees or Medivac drops and later on in the game with Battlecruisers.

Similarly, Zerg may protect Brood Lords from Void Rays with Hydralisks or Corruptors.\n\nThe splash damage of Colossi and Archons can quickly destroy large numbers of Broodlings, reducing the threat of Brood Lords. High Templar with Psionic Storm can also be effective against a Zerg army with Brood Lords, especially if the Brood Lords are clumped together or if the Zerg ground army is positioned beneath the Brood Lords.

{"document": "# 6\nRax Allin\n\n6-rax all-in\nAKA \"The\nMango Build\"Strategy Information\nCreator(s):The\nMango\nMatchups:TvX\nType:All-in, Cheese\nPopularized by:TLO\n\n## Description\n\nThis is an all-in build which aims to kill a fast-expanding opponent before the opponent can reach a second tier of units . It relies on continual Marine reinforcements to cripple or outright kill the opponent. This build has small chance of being mistaken for a 1 Rax FE as there is no add-on on the first Barracks, with one Marine only, and the rest are placed well out of poking units sight range.\n\nTLO used a 7Rax all-in against   IdrA at DreamHack Stockholm Invitational and against   ViBE in NASL 1 with great success but has since switched to 6-Rax instead.\n\n### Goal\n\nPunish an opponent for opening with an economic build or any that cuts early army size. Your reinforcements effectively limit their ability to spend money on anything other than an army, where you have the initial advantage.\n\n## Build Order\n\nTLO's Six Rax in Audio form: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zc3RrQc5lM\n\n| Basic Build Order |\n| --- |\n| 10 - Supply Depot at Choke Point; 12 - Barracks (1) at Choke Point; 15 - Orbital Command; 15 - Marine (1); Stop SCV production; @450 Minerals: - Barracks (2) (3) (4); Continue SCV production; @100 Minerals: - Supply Depot (2) at Choke Point; @300 Minerals: - Barracks (5) (6); Have one Supply Depot queued up constantly after Supply Depot (2) until engagement begins. |\n\n- 10 - Supply Depot at Choke Point\n\n- 12 - Barracks (1) at Choke Point\n\n- 15 - Orbital Command\n\n- 15 - Marine (1)\nStop SCV production\n\n- Stop SCV production\n\n- @450 Minerals: - Barracks (2) (3) (4)\nContinue SCV production\n\n- Continue SCV production\n\n- @100 Minerals: - Supply Depot (2) at Choke Point\n\n- @300 Minerals: - Barracks (5) (6)\nHave one Supply Depot queued up constantly after Supply Depot (2) until engagement begins.\n\n- Have one Supply Depot queued up constantly after Supply Depot (2) until engagement begins.\n\n## Mentality\n\nWith economic builds becoming more and more standard and early safe all-ins by Terrans becoming more rare, it is good to have a couple of deadly all-ins that 'keep the fear alive' by severely damaging or outright killing the opponent's fast expand.\nEven if the rush fails, an opponent may be thrown off of their intended tech path or build order by having had to deal with your attack.\n\n### Notes\n\n- The attack starts as the opponent's natural expansion Hatchery finishes.\n\n- Stop SCV production at 24.\n\n- Kill or scare away any scouts before you start Barracks (2,3,4).\n\n- Only engage one Bunker/Spine Crawler/Cannon at a time, or your Marine count will go down too quickly.\n\n- Constantly produce Supply Depots, as each production cycle will fill available supply, Marines start the engagement.\n\n### Scouting\n\n- Spawning Pool timing in relation to your first Barracks.\n\n- Cybernetics Core timing in relation to second Barracks.\n\n- Bunker and Tech Lab placement.\n\n### Execution\n\n- You want to engage with 12-16 Marines and retreat with about 5-6 Marines remaining.\n\n- Keeping reinforcements back for the first engagement and reinforce with the third wave, and initially maybe mistaken for normal 2Rax Marine pressure poke.\n\n- Stutter step micro to between mineral patches or against walls to reduce attack surface area of the melee units.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Advantageous Features\n\n- Any short rush distance (Steppes of War, Blistering Sands).\n\n- Close positions on some 4-player maps (Metalopolis, Slag Pits).\n\n### Disadvantageous Features\n\n- Multiple attack paths available (Xel'Naga Caverns).\n\n- Long rush distance (Tal'darim Altar).", "question": "What is the primary goal of the 6-rax all-in strategy in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To build a strong economy before engaging the opponent", "To punish an opponent for opening with an economic build or early expansion", "To establish a defensive position with bunkers and turrets", "To create a diverse army composition for mid-game engagements"], "answer": "To punish an opponent for opening with an economic build or early expansion"}
{"document": "# Carrier (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nWith the changes that came in Patch 4.7.1 the Carrier lost it's ability to burst down targets quickly as it used to. The primary reason is the removal of Graviton Catapult which slows down the Carrier's ability to reach full combat capacity. The second change that affects Carriers is the nerf to interceptor build time from 6-11 seconds. In compensation the build time of the Carrier was lowered to 64 seconds and it's HP was buffed to 300 HP from 250 points.\n\nCorruptors are a very strong unit against a Carrier, with their high base speed of 4.725 they can easily hunt down and decimate Carrier fleets without adequate support from Storms, Archons and Voidrays. Hydralisks can also be a problem as they are good at taking down Interceptors quickly.\n\nThe Carrier's role is primarily to force Corruptors from a Zerg and to add extra damage. Making several Carriers in late-game PvZ can cause the Zerg to overcompensate in Corruptors, because of the difficulty in knowing exactly how many Carriers the Protoss wants to make, and how many Corruptors to make per Carrier. Do note however that if a ground transition is made by the Protoss after the Carriers are killed the remaining Corruptors can be morphed into Brood Lords, which may pose a serious problem if you are not adequately prepared for them.\n\nIn conjunction with Archons and the Mothership, Carriers will decimate the Zerg's late-game Brood Lord/Infestor/Corruptor army composition. Carriers can easily pull back to the cover of the Archons while Corruptors try to focus fire on the Carriers and Mothership. Due to the AI, the Corruptors will stack up quite a bit when focusing the Carriers, thus rendering them susceptible for insane amounts of Archon splash damage. Once the Corruptors are dead, Brood Lords will fall along with the Infestors.", "question": "What unit can effectively hunt down and decimate Carrier fleets without adequate support from other Protoss units?", "options": ["Hydralisks", "Roaches", "Corruptors", "Ultralisks"], "answer": "Corruptors"}

{"document": "# 2 Base Templar (vs. Terran)\n## FAQ\n\nIs this style viable on every map?\n\nYes it is.\n\nI am in league x, am I ready to do this build or is it too hard for me?\n\nYeah go for it. It takes practice but it’s really fun, so why not? The worst case scenario is to grab a practice partner or play unranked. If you play this style enough you will even find it easier than Colossus builds. If you aren't confident in your multitasking, try cutting out the Warp Prism harassment at first.\n\nHe did a weird push before Medivacs and killed me because I was too greedy. How can I hold it?\n\nYou should be able to hold most pushes thanks to the Mothership Core and careful scouting. To make sure you see any kind of push coming before your Observer crosses the map and scouts him, keep the initial Stalker in front of his natural and watch the minimap carefully. This isn’t as important as it was in WoL, but it’s very useful regardless. Cut tech and Chronoboost out units the instant you see him moving out.\n\nWhy a single Forge and not double Forge?\n\nTwo-base double Forge together with Templar play isn't very popular because of a glaring issue with it: there is a timing when you want to get 3/3 and a bunch of Templar up with it but the gas is never enough, so what usually happens is the 3/3 gets delayed. If you are going to delay 3/3 a bit then you might as well go for the single Forge and maximize the number of units you can get.\n\nAdditionally, you can get the single Forge extremely quickly without being punished, which already produces fast upgrades in addition to providing early defense in the form of Cannons.\n\nIs it possible to play aggressively with this build? Are there any timings to hit?\n\nIf you try to push across the map with a Chargelot/Templar army and meet him halfway through the map, your Zealots will get kited while the Templar are left behind and unable to land any Storms. On the other hand, if he is attacking into you he will run straight toward the Templar, exposing himself to Storm (and making you feel fucking awesome when you land them). It’s also easier to land Storms when your opponent is bunched up and backed in a corner, for example, at his natural expansion.\n\nKeeping this in mind, while it is possible to play aggressively with this army composition, it’s a lot easier to defend and harass with it, especially because the Terran can’t really micro on two fronts effectively, thus making your Chargelots deadly. With a Colossus army you might be able to A-move across the map and win, but with a Gateway army you need more careful positioning and army movement or you risk missing key storms or losing Zealots for nothing. For example, in one of the linked games Trap loses against SuperNova because he wastes 3-4 Storms trying to break a third that wasn’t even started yet, and as a result he doesn’t have enough to defend SuperNova’s counter attack despite having +3 armor and a superior economy.\n\nThat said, the Warp Prisms really help with keeping the Terran back, so it’s possible to push across the map once Storm and a key upgrade (like +2 or +3 armor) is done, especially if you are ahead after defending a timing or harassing him. In other words, do not engage mid map: either play defensively or push when you are sure he is forced to stay in his base.\n\nWhat do I do against mech?\n\nThis kind of opening is arguably superior vs mech compared to Colossus builds. You have more map control, harassment tools, a fast third, and access to Immortals early on, all of which are very strong in that spot. Obviously, you need to add Immortals to your composition to take care of the tanks. Double Robo Immortal after securing the third is a strong transition.\n\nWhat do I do if he’s doing a 2 base all-in with Thor/Banshee or Tank/Banshee?\n\nAgainst that kind of all-in you can easily get Storm up in time, so go for it ASAP while getting your Immortal count up. A good sample VOD of such a hold (even though it’s a WoL game) is Hero vs SuperNova on Atlantis Spaceship.\n\nDon't Hellbats counter this?", "question": "Why is a single Forge preferred over double Forge in the 2 Base Templar build against Terran?", "options": ["A single Forge is faster to build and provides early defense with Cannons.", "A double Forge allows for quicker production of units.", "A single Forge makes it easier to manage gas and mineral resources.", "A double Forge is necessary to support the production of Colossi."], "answer": "A single Forge is faster to build and provides early defense with Cannons."}

{"document": "# StarCraft\n## Game Mechanics\n### Balancing Micro & Macro\n\nWhile it is ideal to perform optimal micro and macro, it is usually impossible to do both tasks together as well as one could perform each separately. Thus, a player is forced to make the decision where to allocate his or her actions and attention. In order to win, a player should consider the opportunity cost of his or her choice. By spending attention on micro, we are omitting macro, and vice-versa. It is generally accepted that good macro is more valuable than good micro.\n\nSo why is macro better? Consider pitting a micro-oriented player against a macro-oriented player both with the same amount of attention and APM. Overall, the macro player will have a better economy and more units, and can usually overpower the micro player no matter how good his or her control is. Because of this, attention to macro is generally more valuable than attention to micro. Since focus on macro is the better choice, let us consider the case of two macro-oriented players with the same amount of attention. Both will amass a similarly-sized army and both will have similar economies, so who is victorious? It comes down to unit positioning and the outcome of battles; essentially micro.\n\nThus, players who want to win will practice both micro and macro in order to out-micro and out-produce their opponents. The marginal benefit of micro will be apparent if the macro abilities of the players are the same. Good players will allocate the appropriate time for each to get the most benefit from their actions. It is a good idea to also take into consideration the cost to your opponent when deciding between micro and macro as well, and how well off you will be in relation to your opponent when you decide, for example, to spend time controlling Mutalisks to destroy SCVs. You may reduce your opponent's income but you may also forget to make more Drones at the right time. If you switch to production, you may leave your Mutalisks vulnerable or simply unused. In this sense the game becomes a balancing act between micro and macro.", "question": "Why is macro considered more valuable than micro in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Because micro requires more attention and APM than macro.", "Because a strong economy and more units usually lead to victory.", "Because micro-oriented players can always overpower macro-oriented players.", "Because macro does not require as much practice as micro."], "answer": "Because a strong economy and more units usually lead to victory."}

{"document": "# Warp Prism (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Warp Prism is arguably the most important component of the PvZ matchup. Timing attacks do not work without a prism to provide a reinforcement point and if the prism dies or was never present the push will lose it's ability to continue momentum once a good portion of the initial units have been killed.\n\nIt's also the most consistent harassment tool that a Protoss can have. A prism that can stay alive can keep the Zerg at home for long periods of time or deal deadly amounts of damage to an undefended mineral line. It can also save a small amount of the units used to harass or warp them in beforehand to provide additional units for the harass. A skilled player will usually never risk losing a prism just to get a lot of Drones in one go but rather deal harass in small amounts adding up.\n\nCompared to other forms of harassment such as Phoenix or Oracles Warp Prisms do not need to put themselves in direct danger to deal damage, they can fly in warp in at a blind spot and then get out and let the Zealots deal the harass on their own. They can also just set up from a distance and warpin from there to be used as a runby.", "question": "In the Protoss vs. Zerg matchup in StarCraft II, what role does the Warp Prism play in harassment strategies?", "options": ["It serves as a mobile platform to warp in units for harassment, reducing direct risk.", "It acts as a stationary defense structure to protect against Zerg attacks.", "It is used to detect cloaked units, providing vision for harassment.", "It functions as a transport unit to move large groups of units at once."], "answer": "It serves as a mobile platform to warp in units for harassment, reducing direct risk."}

{"document": "# Harassment\n## Common Methods of Harassment\n### Zerg\n\n- Mutalisks are a very strong harassment unit due to their mobility, high damage output and splash damage. Zerg players frequently use them as a \"surprise tactic\" by transitioning to Mutalisks after they have opened with an other unit combination and try to exploit the fact that the opponent may not have adequate anti-air defenses ready.\n\n- Infestors can be used in conjunction with their Fungal Growth ability to damage and possibly destroy large numbers of workers. Because however a single Fungal Growth is not enough to kill a worker they do not see much use. Also, only one Fungal Growth is needed to kill larva.\n\n- Roaches with the Tunneling Claws upgrade are sometimes used to sneak past an opponent's defenses if he lacks detection and unburrow near his mineral line targeting workers.\n\n- Banelings have excellent splash damage and are often used to sneak into an enemy mineral line. They can also be dropped from an Overlord directly on the workers, avoiding any base defenses that may exist. When you have the +2 melee upgrade it only takes one Baneling to kill a Probe or a Drone (SCVs still take two Banelings to die).\n\n- Zerglings have an ability to sneak around the enemy's army, and attack any unguarded mineral line. A common thing is in ZvZ where micro with Queens and Zerglings is of huge importance since a run-by into the main mineral line can result in heavy Drone losses. If you have a Baneling Nest you can hide 2-6 Zerglings in your opponent's base while attacking his Drones and turn them into Banelings. After he cleans it up, you simply wait, and when he gets his Drone count up, you distract him with some Zerglings and explode to kill a huge amount of Drones again.\n\n- A single Lurker can effectively shut down the enemy mineral line until detection arrives.", "question": "Which Zerg unit can effectively shut down the enemy mineral line until detection arrives?", "options": ["Mutalisks", "Infestors", "Lurkers", "Banelings"], "answer": "Lurkers"}

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Terran\n## The Early Game\n### Defending the 2 Barracks Play\n\nThe very first thing you must do is identify the 2 Barracks play. With your 15 scout, move into your opponent's main base:\n\n- If you see one Barracks building at the top of your opponent's ramp, it's usually not a 2 Barracks play (but still could be). Generally, your Terran opponent will take his natural expansion at the 3:08 mark - if you don't see this, start getting suspicious. Send a Drone to the watchtower, just to check. Another clear giveaway is if your opponent sends more than one SCV to \"scout\". If so, you're probably being 2 Barracks rushed.\n\n- If you see two Barracks building, you've identified the build.\n\n- If you see no Barracks building (and no gas), keep in mind that your opponent can be doing 1 of 3 things: proxy 2 Barracks, proxy 1 Barracks to pressure, and finally Command Center first. The proper thing to do here is to search with both your scouting Drone and send one Drone from your main to check the nooks and crannies around your half of the map for Barracks play - if you can't find them quickly in the likely spots, move one of your Drones to a watchtower or a position in front of your base where you can see the pressure coming.\n\nSo now you've identified the 2 Barracks play. If you defend properly you should be fine. Keep one Drone in front of your natural, checking to make sure that SCVs don't build any Bunkers. Keep in mind that you don't want to over-pull Drones: you want to mine as much money as possible before sending all of your Drones to defend. When you see the first Bunker building, pull around five Drones. 2 Bunker rushes generally happen in stages:", "question": "In the context of defending against a 2 Barracks rush in StarCraft II, what is the recommended number of Drones to pull for defense when you first see a Bunker being built?", "options": ["1-2 Drones", "3-4 Drones", "5 Drones", "All Drones"], "answer": "5 Drones"}
{"document": "# Campaign/Ghost of a Chance\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n#### Section Two\n\nYou'll soon appear in the next area of the map, with just Nova. When you advance forward, a Dominion patrol will come to check you out, with a Raven flying with them. Dominate the Raven, then the Dominion patrol will have no detection, thus enabling you to kill them all easily. Advance forward with Nova as there's no detection in this area, and destroy all enemy units in the area. This will allow your reinforcements to land, which turns out to be 8 Reapers, 2 Siege Tanks, and a Raven.\n\nUse the Raven to spot for your Siege Tanks, and take out the Missile Turret on the other side of the ridge. Then jump your Reapers over, and take out the Siege Tank and Marines on the lower ground, as they can't see up the cliff. Then take out the Gate Control. Move forward until you see a Bunker. You'll want to siege up your Tanks, and take it out.\n\nMove Nova up first, and advance up the high ground that you see. On the top you'll see a Banshee and a Siege Tank. Take out the Siege Tank first, then bring your Ravens with Nova, and take out the Banshee as well. Bring your Siege Tanks to the top of the high ground, and destroy everything below. Once you destroy the Turret, you can use Nova to pick off the survivors.\n\nBe careful when advancing any further, as there's detection on the high ground. Keep your Siege Tanks to the right side, and use your Ravens for sight. Pick off all Missile Turrets in the area, and move Nova forward to kill the Spectre. If you accidentally move any units aside from Nova into the sight range of the Specter, it will call down a Nuke, so you'll want to back your units away.\n\nAfter you pick off the Spectre, move your Tanks in range of the high ground to the left, use your Ravens for sight, and destroy all units there. After which, move Nova onto the high ground, destroy the Turret and the units there with Tanks, and capture the Nuke Silo. Move Nova up onto the high ground where the Terrazine Tanks are, and call down a Nuke on the units gathered there.

{"document": "# Bio-Tank (vs. Zerg)\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Bio-Tank build relies on Hellion openings and Siege Tank-expansion timings to secure fast expansions and deny Zerg a fast third base. Meanwhile, Terran can muster a strong Marine force off of two or three bases to repel Mutalisk-harass.\n\nSiege Tanks are used as the stopping power for Barracks units, mainly against Banelings, and are still just as effective against Armored units like the Roach and Infestor.\n\n## Goal\n\nA Hellion opening gives the Terran good map control against Zerg and can deny early Creep-spread. This allows any follow-up aggression to come closer to the Zerg natural resulting in less time for the Zerg to react. When use effectively, this map control can help secure a fast third base expansion.\n\nSiege Tanks and a moderate amount of Marines (with Stimpack) can be used to control the choke points close to your third or gold base location, which Terran can use for good early game economy.\n\nThe tactics vary from Medivac-drops to early two Factory Siege Tank-pushes (whether it be Mech or Bio centric). The goal is to deny early third bases and then push while the Zerg Tech or economy is damaged. The older style relied on two-base aggression, while the new Macro style relies on Medivac-drops and a faster third.\n\n## Build Recipe\n\n- Open with either a few Reapers or Hellions to force Zerg to have to fight for map control.\n\n- Have a fast Factory ready to produce Siege Tanks and start Engineering Bay and other Bio upgrades to strengthen the coming Marine-aggression.\n\n- Add Medivacs as you move out, wastes gas that should be spent on army, add Thors if the opponent goes for Mutalisks or Marauder/Ghosts to deal with Infestors/Roaches and Hive-tech units.\n\n## Suicidal Aggression versus Uber-Ups\n\nSuicidal Aggression: The previous style of Bio-Tank that either used a Medivac-drop harass style to attack wherever Mutalisks where not; or 3 Barracks, 2 Factory aggression (delaying Medivacs) to push Zerg back into the natural. This style was able to pull the Zerg's army all over the place and discouraged Zerg from taking risky expansions making it easier to perform a Siege Tank-contain as the late game strategy.\n\nUber-Ups covers the current style of TvZ that is an upgrade war that aims to complete Infantry Weapons and Armour quicker than the Zerg is able to upgrade, sometimes not even moving out before completing 2-2, and it aims to trade armies cost-effectively while denying additional expansions of Zerg rather than containing Zerg. This style is preferred for maps that have an easy to defend third base such as; Antiga Shipyard, Tal'Darim Altar, etc.\n\n## Expansions\n\nThe most important part of TvZ is being able to deny Zerg additional bases past three, when playing aggressively; however, the main goal should be either to secure three mining bases or mass a big enough army to take a Gold Expansion and try to overwhelm the Zerg player with Marines.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of using Siege Tanks in the Bio-Tank strategy against Zerg?", "options": ["To provide air support against Mutalisks", "To control map choke points and deny Zerg expansions", "To serve as a defensive structure against Banelings and Armored units", "To scout and harass the Zerg's economy"], "answer": "To serve as a defensive structure against Banelings and Armored units"}

If the Cybernetics Core or a Gateway is powered by one Pylon it is a good idea to take the Pylon down and then attacking the Protoss economy.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nThis build is an all-in and, unless you do damage, you will be far behind. If you must transition out of it, try to expand and pump drones. Be alert for an opportunity to backstab/counterattack when your opponent moves out to buy you additional time.\n\n### Transitons\n\nThis is an all-in, so if you haven't done enough damage to the Protoss economy he should be ahead in terms of Harvester-Count.\nTry to Expand and pump drones, than transition into a normal Roach-Hydra-Corruptor Composition.\n\n## Counter\n\nScout the timing. scout for Roach Warren just after pool, keep probe scouting Zerg base just until lings are coming out.\n\nMake a second Gateway to complete your wall.

{"document": "# Hydralisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Hydralisk is a ranged Lair-tech unit that can be morphed after building a Hydralisk Den.  The Hydralisk's fast attack and high damage, along with not relying on bonuses to specific unit types, makes it consistently effective at dealing damage to both ground and air targets.  Can morph into the Lurker after morphing the Hydralisk Den into a Lurker Den.\n\nDue to the large difference in speed off-creep and on-creep, the Muscular Augments upgrade and/or spreading creep should be a key focus when executing any Hydra-based strategy.\n\nHydralisks (and Lurkers) are made for their attack range to counter units with a similar attack range like Stalkers and Marauders.  Hydralisks are fragile, so they are often paired with high health Roaches to tank and Burrow/Tunneling Claws combo to retreat the low health Roaches.  This simple and forgiving unit composition is great for lower level players that wish to practice their micro with a friend against Terran Barracks or Protoss Gateway units before moving onto a more complex unit composition.  They are the only Zerg ground units that can attack air other than Queens.\n\nNote that while the Hydralisk also has a melee attack animation when attacking ground units at melee range, this attack is still affected by the normal Ranged Attack upgrades. However, this close range attack is not affected by Guardian Shield or the now removed point Defense Drone.", "question": "Which of the following is a key focus when executing a Hydra-based strategy due to the Hydralisk's speed differences on and off-creep?", "options": ["Spreading creep", "Increasing Hydralisk speed", "Upgrading Hydralisk armor", "Building more Hydralisk Dens"], "answer": "Spreading creep"}

{"document": "# 2 Rax Opening\n\n2 Rax Opening - Bunker Rush into Fast Expand\nStrategy Information\nCreator(s):Marine\nKing\nPrime\nMatchups:TvX\nType:Aggro, Rush, Cheese\n\n## Overview\n\nAn offensive rush off of two fast Barracks, this build is to abuse the commonly used fast expand builds in all match-ups. The attack should only last as long as it can do damage, this is a rush and loses power the longer the attack lasts because only two Barracks are producing. After the attack Factory or Starport tech is a must, the opponent will have adjusted to an anti-Marine strategy by then.\n\nIt should be noted that this build and all the others mentioned in Adaptions are weak to counter-attacks or pushes straight after you have finished the attack, hence why you will need to do considerable damage or keep the opponent busy with Bunkers to buy time.\n\n## Goal\n\nUsually a 3 or 5 Marine push with 3-6 SCVs for tanking and Bunkers. Once the Bunkers are finished, do not reinforce, work up a strong economy for a transition.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Two Rax Opening |\n| --- |\n| 10 - Supply Depot (1) + scout; 12 - Proxy Barracks (1), if the opponent was scouted right away; 14 - Barracks (2), in base; 15 - Orbital Command Upgrade; 15 - Marines, rally to 10 - scout; 16 - Supply Depot (2); 19 - Offensive Bunkers (1 & 2); 24 - Supply Depot (3) |\n|  |\n\n- 10 - Supply Depot (1) + scout\n\n- 12 - Proxy Barracks (1), if the opponent was scouted right away\n\n- 14 - Barracks (2), in base\n\n- 15 - Orbital Command Upgrade\n\n- 15 - Marines, rally to 10 - scout\n\n- 16 - Supply Depot (2)\n\n- 19 - Offensive Bunkers (1 & 2)\n\n- 24 - Supply Depot (3)\n\n## Notes & Transitions\n\n- This attack should ideally come before the opponent can have Ranged units that can pick at building SCVs, if the opponent puts down defensive structures (like Spine Crawlers and Photon Cannons) then simply wait until you have a large number of units and run past.\n\n- The standard transition is to throw down one or two Command Centers and Bunker up until you can hit with Factory tech units, ideally having Stimpack finished for the second attack (for trading army for economy damage). But, you definitely want a strong mineral income to be able to power ahead of the opponent.\n\n## Execution\n\n- Bunker position: If the opponent has expanded, dump one Bunker in a corner where it is hard for workers and melee troops to hit. The second should take into account ranged units and be in range of the ramp.\nIf the opponent has not expanded, try to get a Bunker in range of one or more farms (Supply Depots or Pylons.\n\n- If the opponent has not expanded, try to get a Bunker in range of one or more farms (Supply Depots or Pylons.\n\n## Adaptation\n\n- Three Rax Opening is sometimes used on longer distance maps with no proxy, and hits with 12 Marines, which most early anti-Marine defenses will have difficulty with, but does put Terran behind a fast expanding opponent.\n\n- FE into 4 Rax Poke, is sometimes used against greedy opponent's that straight tech to Colossus, Siege Tanks and other gas-heavy units, this attack hits just before crucial 2-base tech would finish.\n\n## Maps\n\n- Two player maps, where there is no need to scout for the opponent's position.\n\n- Rush distance will determine how far forward the Barracks should be placed and how much time the opponent has to react to the Marines pushing across if they are spotted.\n\n- Small closed naturals with not much room for Bunkers, may be better to just wall off part of it.", "question": "In the 2 Rax Opening strategy, what is the primary purpose of placing Bunkers during the attack?", "options": ["To serve as a distraction while you expand", "To protect SCVs and Marines from enemy units", "To block the opponent's workers from accessing their mineral line", "To provide a defensive structure for your own base"], "answer": "To protect SCVs and Marines from enemy units"}
{"document": "# Bischu Anti-4\nGate (vs. Protoss)\n\nBischu's Zealot-Immortal Tal'Darim 4 Gate counter (vs. Protoss)\nZealots and Immortals laughing at Stalkers.Strategy Information\nCreator(s):Bischu\nMatchups:PvP\nType:Opening\n\n## Overview\n\nThis build was developed as a direct counter to the 4 Gate on Tal'Darim Altar by Bischu.\n\nIt is an unbelievably straight forward strategy to execute. All the minerals line up almost perfectly, as well as the gas. The two important points are to never get supply blocked and take the gas as soon as you have 75 minerals on 14 supply as well as saturating it as soon as it finishes. If you do not do both, the Robo and the Warpgate will be delayed, as well as the Immortal, leading to a swift 4 gate related demise.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Bischu Anti-4Gate |\n| --- |\n| 9 Pylon; @100% Pylon; Chrono Boost Nexus; 12.75 Chrono Boost Nexus; 13 Gateway, Scout; 14 Assimilator (1); 16 Pylon; 17 Cybernetics Core; 18 Zealot; 22 Robo; cut Probe production; @150 minerals Gateway (2); @50 gas Warp Gate; @100 Minerals constantly produce Zealots.; 24 Immortal; 28 Zealot; NB: it is more important to not get supply blocked than to have constant Zealot production, as constant chronoboosted Immortals are essential. |\n|  |\n\n- 9 Pylon\n\n- @100% Pylon; Chrono Boost Nexus\n\n- 12.75 Chrono Boost Nexus\n\n- 13 Gateway, Scout\n\n- 14 Assimilator (1)\n\n- 16 Pylon\n\n- 17 Cybernetics Core\n\n- 18 Zealot\n\n- 22 Robo; cut Probe production\n\n- @150 minerals Gateway (2)\n\n- @50 gas Warp Gate\n\n- @100 Minerals constantly produce Zealots.\n\n- 24 Immortal\n\n- 28 Zealot\n\nNB: it is more important to not get supply blocked than to have constant Zealot production, as constant chronoboosted Immortals are essential.\n\n## Maps\n\nThis build is designed specifically for Tal'Darim Altar. It is also potent on any map without a ramp (thus provoking the opponent to 4 gate), that is large enough for the first Stalker to not be able to simply turn up and kill the defending player.\n\n## Countered by\n\nAccording to NightEnD at HomeStory Cup IV builds such as this are easily dealt with by the 4 Gater warping in pure Zealots for a round or two before attacking. Due to the absence of a Stalker it is easy to scout, and so this build can only work as a surprise counter. Through much testing, if the defender micros well and adds another Gateway while only chronoboosting his own Gateways it is possible to hold once all the Stalkers are dead by kiting with the Immortals until the 4 gate runs out of money.\n\n## Transitions\n\nI have found a double Immortal Warp Prism drop to be a strong transition out of this, while continuing Immortal production and slowly teching to Blink by adding the second gas, resuming probe production and adding Stalkers.\n\nWhen doing a double Immortal drop in PvP, remember that probes die in a single volley, Stalkers are made of paper and Pylons die in seconds. With good micro, this can easily win you the game as the Warp Prism should be nigh on unkillable due to the opponent's lack of gas. Beware of a counter, and be prepared to pull probes if they do.\n\n## External links\n\n- Analysis of this build by Bischu in the first IPL Team Arena Challenge on TeamLiquid\n\n- VOD", "question": "In Bischu's Anti-4 Gate strategy, what is the critical action that must be prioritized to ensure the timely production of key units?", "options": ["Constantly producing Zealots", "Taking the gas at 75 minerals on 14 supply", "Saturating the gas as soon as it finishes", "Not getting supply blocked"], "answer": "Not getting supply blocked"}

{"document": "# Cloning\n\n Cloning\nCloning scourge against Science Vessels in Starcraft 1.Strategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Unit Positioning, Tactic\n\nCloning is the act of giving multiple units the same order to different places or enemies.\n\n## The Art of Cloning\n\nConsider the following - You are on a four player map with each player in his respective corner (Kulas Ravine, Metalopolis) and you want to scout each corner of the map with three Zerglings to detect any hidden expansions. To achieve this goal, one could do this:\n\n### Method 1\n\n- Select one Zergling.\n\n- Click on one corner of the map.\n\n- Go back to your base. Select another Zergling.\n\n- Click on another corner of the map.\n\n- Go back to your base. Select the final Zergling.\n\n- Click on the last portion of the map.\n\nThis is the brute force way of sending similar units to do the same thing in different places. A far faster method is the following:\n\n### Method 2\n\n- Select all three Zerglings.\n\n- Tell all three Zerglings to go to one corner of the map.\n\n- Deselect one of the Zerglings.\n\n- Tell two Zerglings to go to another corner of the map.\n\n- Deselect one of the Zerglings (or select the final Zergling)\n\n- Tell the final Zergling to go to the final corner of the map.\n\nNote in Method 2 you should be using the wireframes (those in the UI at the bottom of the screen) to deselect Zerglings as it is much quicker. To do this press Shift+Left Click on the icon.\n\nThe second method uses Cloning and is far faster to execute than the first method because there is no need to return to the base to click on each individual Zergling. Also, the cloning method gets all Zerglings to their destination faster because all of them are moving as of step 2.\n\nHere's another example. Suppose you are Zerg and you just set up a new base which has 1 Hatchery and 2 Extractors. You want to get the new base set up as quickly as possible. You can send over 10 drones.\n\n### Method 1\n\n- Select 3 drones.\n\n- Send to one Extractor\n\n- Go back to base. Select another 3 drones.\n\n- Send to second Extractor\n\n- Go back to base. Select another 4 drones.\n\n- Send to minerals.\n\n### Method 2\n\n- Select all 10 drones.\n\n- Send them all to the first Extractor\n\n- Deselect 3 drones\n\n- Send all 7 to the second Extractor\n\n- Deselect 3 drones\n\n- Send the rest to minerals\n\nAgain, the second method uses cloning to achieve the same results but with much faster timing. Also, in the second method all of the drones are moving as of step 2 to go to the expansion which results in minerals hitting your bank quicker.\n\nHere's a video example of Method 2:\n\n| VOD |\n| --- |\n| Load videoYouTubeYouTube might collect personal data.

{"document": "# Gas Steal\n\n Gas Steal\nA gas steal by a Protoss player against Terran\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Harass, Tactic\n\n## Definition\n\nA Gas Steal means you block your opponent's Vespene Geyser by placing one of your own extraction buildings on top of it. This is typically performed in the early game, denying the opponent their initial Gas production. This can potentially devastate an opponent early on, since it may interrupt their build order. It is commonly used in PvP to force a 4 gate. Further, if the opponent has not yet produced combat units then workers are sent to destroy the building, leading to lost Mineral income and delayed Gas income.\n\nProtoss is perhaps the best at gas stealing because a Probe can keep moving after it starts warping in an Assimilator.  Terran on the other hand is at a disadvantage because an SCV has to stay to do the construction work and can be killed while doing so.  Gas stealing as Zerg is generally seen as a no-lose situation. Many players see that the drone is likely to die anyway once the scout is over, so it may as well gas steal. Some players repeatedly cancel and rebuild their Extractor to prolong the time the gas is stolen for  and forcing the opponent (specifically Terrans or Zerg) to get more units to kill the Gas Steal.[1]\n\n## Effectiveness of Gas Stealing\n\nWhile a Gas Steal can potentially cause significant damage to your opponent, it can also hurt you in some occasions. If for example a Terran player goes for a 1 Rax FE opening, stealing their gas will not only have no effect on them since they only need one gas but it will also put you further behind in terms of economy against their macro-oriented build. So before you incorporate a Gas Steal into your standard play you should consider what you aim to gain from it. The losses from doing this as Zerg are much more minimal than Protoss or Terran however, because you only lose 7 minerals for each cancel, but 25 minerals and a drone worth 50 minerals if you let it finish.\n\nGenerally, two are the possible advantages of stealing an opponent's gas:\n\n- It forces your opponent to pull units away from their choke to kill the building. This lack of defense in your opponent's front can either be exploited if you plan to commit to an early attack or even to allow you to get a second scout in their base, if you feel you have to scout again to see an important part of their build.\n\n- It delays their tech. This may initially seem advantageous in every situation but you need to keep in mind that your own tech/unit production will also be delayed due to the minerals spent on the Assimilator/Refinery/Extractor. The following factors should be  considered before deciding to steal the opponent's gas:\nThe build you intend to perform and possible weaknesses it may have to fast tech openings\nThe starting locations in order to decide if these \"tech builds\" are a possible and effective choice for your opponent.\n\n- The build you intend to perform and possible weaknesses it may have to fast tech openings\n\n- The starting locations in order to decide if these \"tech builds\" are a possible and effective choice for your opponent.\n\nFor example a Protoss player at 12 o'clock on Lost Temple that wants to go for a build that gets a rather late Robotics Facility against a Terran on 2 o'clock may want to steal their gas to prevent or delay them from teching to cloaked Banshees since your opponent will lack detection early on.\nOn the other hand a Protoss player that is two gate rushing their opponent will not benefit from a Gas Steal not only because they need as many minerals as possible, but also because if the opponent is allowed to go up the tech tree your opponent will have fewer units defending against the incoming Zealots.\n\n## Notes\n\n- ↑ oGs???? vs HyperDub in XPT Team Tournament.", "question": "Which race is generally seen as having a no-lose situation when gas stealing due to the drone likely dying anyway once the scout is over?", "options": ["Protoss", "Terran", "Zerg", "None of the above"], "answer": "Zerg"}

They should only directly engage an army when they massively outnumber the opposing force or are supporting a large ground force. Their strength lies in their mobility, picking off stray units, workers, and buildings. Because few units are fast enough to keep up with Mutalisks, they provide indirect map control - if an enemy balls up their forces to take the offensive, Mutalisks can be used to pick off buildings and units within the enemy base, forcing the enemy back to defend.\n\nDeciding how many Mutalisks to morph is crucial.

{"document": "# Siege Tank (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### In General\n\n- The Siege Tank's greatest asset is its range of 13.  This is 2 matrices greater than the Tank's vision, so maximization of tank effectiveness requires a spotter, such as a Viking, Reaper or Xel'Naga Tower (or sacrificing Orbital Command energy for a Scanner Sweep). Placing Siege Tanks behind cliff ledges or a Wall-Off will obstruct an opponent's ground army from bum rushing into the Tanks more effectively.  Also, to note floating Terran units act as both spots and a mobile Wall-Off that has been commonly used.\n\n- Against high health units like the Colossus and Ultralisks the Liberator can be produced from a Reactor and has higher single target damage, making it easier to produce (Usually) 2 Starports late game; rather than the amount of Factories needed for the ground only Siege Tank.

{"document": "# Archon (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nArchons are strong against almost every Protoss unit, but most notably when up against Gateway units. Zealots are eaten up by splash and bonus damage while Adepts can't deal any real damage against them. Sentries are worthless because Archons break force fields.\n\nIn terms of splash counters however Archons are countered by Disruptors due to the latter's bonus vs shields and the former's inability to reliably dodge purification novas without prism pickup micro. However the Archon's large size makes it so that splash of a Purification Nova isn't able to hit much else.\n\nSaving Archons from near death and throwing them back into your army when their shields recharge can be a deciding factor in this match up, since small economical gains in a mirror match can make or break a game.\n\nGenerally the way to counter Archons is by simply focus firing them. Usually however PvP engagements end up being prism micro competitions in which the player who can juggle his units better wins.\n\nArchons are \"Massive\", and can therefore destroy Force Fields. Note that the perimeter in which Archons destroy Force Fields is larger than what the model might indicate.\n\nAnother use for Archons in PvP is against Void Rays and Carriers.

{"document": "# Spine Crawler (Legacy of the Void)\n## Offensive Uses\n\nAlthough it can only be burrowed on creep, there have been a few instances of offensive use, similar to a Protoss cannon rush. This is enabled by an Overlord generating creep near an opponents location or an expansion that is about to be taken by an opponent.\n\nA Spine Crawler rush can be performed even earlier in a ZvZ due to the existence of creep in an enemy Zerg's base. Spine Crawler rushes in ZvZ are most effective before the opponent has a Lair. This is due to the sight range of a Hatchery being slightly smaller than the creep range of the Hatchery. This gives a small area on the edge of the creep where a Spine Crawler can be placed outside the vision of the Hatchery. A Lair has greater vision than a Hatchery and does not have this blind spot.\n\nInstead of an Overlord (requires Lair), creep for offensive Spine Crawlers may also be generated via the following procedure:\n\n- Move a Queen and a Drone to the desired creep location.\n\n- Start morphing a Drone into a Hatchery at the desired location.\n\n- Cancel the morphing Hatchery and immediately place a Creep Tumor on the creep left by the cancelled Hatchery.\n\nVOD: Argos Zenith (Z) vs Chita Prime (P) on Metalopolis by BlizShouter\n\nIn ZvP, a common Lategame strategy is to build large numbers of Spine Crawlers to act as support for Brood Lords, the Spine Crawlers being positioned beneath the Brood Lords in order to deter Stalkers from Blinking underneath the Brood Lords and taking them out, since Spine Crawlers deal additional damage to Armored units (such as Stalkers) and are very potent against such units when in large numbers. In addition, Infestors can be used to root Stalkers in place (via the use of Fungal Growth) should they decide to Blink beneath the Brood Lords, preventing them from Blinking back and escaping the Spine Crawlers. Assuming the creep spread is sufficient, the Zerg player can slowly move the Spine Crawlers \"wall\" (by uprooting and rooting them) towards the opponent's base, along with the Brood Lords and the rest of the army, in a way that is somewhat reminiscent of a Terran player leapfrogging Siege Tanks towards the enemy's base.", "question": "In ZvZ, why is a Spine Crawler rush most effective before the opponent has a Lair?", "options": ["Because the opponent cannot produce sufficient units to defend.", "Because the sight range of a Hatchery is slightly smaller than its creep range, creating a blind spot.", "Because the Spine Crawler deals more damage before the opponent has a Lair.", "Because the opponent cannot spread creep without a Lair."], "answer": "Because the sight range of a Hatchery is slightly smaller than its creep range, creating a blind spot."}
{"document": "# Two Rax Pressure FE (vs. Zerg)\n\nTwo Rax Pressure > CC Opening\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:TvZ\nType:Opening\nPopularized by:Marine\nKing\nPrime\n\n## Overview\n\nOpening with two fast Barracks to give a quick attack group to hit just before Zerglings have started, meaning the opponent will have to defend with Drones or lose the opposing natural base to a Bunker rush.\n\nThis is a very economic Terran opening while forcing the Zerg player to invest minerals in anything but Drones to defend the early Marine pressure. There are a few all-in variations of this build but a more popular build when choosing to all-in is the 11-11 Rax build which hits at a much earlier timing and is more designed to win the game early.\n\nThis build was much more popular before the Queen range buff in mid-2012. Since then more Terrans have favored a simple 1rax FE or a more aggressive 11-11rax. 12-14rax has become a more middle road build which has fallen a bit out of style in recent modern TvZ.

Most common placement is between the mineral line and the Hatchery.\n\n## Scouting\n\n- Once the opponent has been located, check for Extractors and Spawning Pool timing, this information will be useful for determining the Metabolic Boost timing and whether Roaches are likely, by double-checking the Extractor for whether Drones are still on it after the pressure.\n\n## Adaption\n\n- On longer distances, a proxy is recommended to hit a Hatchery First build, and pulling some SCVs for Bunkers.\n\n- The follow up can be a quick Hellion or a slower Siege Tank and Starport production depending how much army the opponent has now, more defense will be needed against Roaches and Baneling Busts.", "question": "What is the primary goal of the Two Rax Pressure FE strategy in the TvZ matchup?", "options": ["To create a large army of Marauders before the Zerg has Roaches", "To harass the Zerg with early Marine pressure before Zerglings are available", "To quickly expand and tech to air units", "To force the Zerg to build more Queens for defense"], "answer": "To harass the Zerg with early Marine pressure before Zerglings are available"}

Introducing the map, Blizzard said:\n\nThe rush distance on this map is comparable to Shakuras Plateau or the longest distance on Metalopolis. We tried to go for a slightly more exposed natural expansion, followed up by a greater choice of which third expansion to take. The high-yield expansion offers better resource acquisition, but is also the most difficult to defend, while the corner expansion is similar to expansions found on Metalopolis or Shattered Temple. The base closest to your main is open, but remains easy to defend because of short travel time from the natural expansion. We wanted to go for a more open center with very powerful Watch Tower placements.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nThe area leading to the center of the map is wide open.

In addition, being a Massive unit makes them immune to being slowed by concussive shells. However care must be taken to avoid exposing Archons to direct fire from large groups. Finally, it is important to note that the Ghost EMP Round will only drain 100 shields from the Archons affected, instead of the whole amount as it did previously.\n\nAgainst Mech in LOTV, the Archon is now the most durable unit against Siege Tank fire, due to its lack of an armored tag and changes to the Immortal's shield ability. Even if the two units have similar numerical values of HP, the Archon will take far less damage due to its non-armored classification.\n\nIn terms of game pacing, after being harassed with Dark Templar, a Terran player will place down Missile Turrets greatly limiting access to his base with cloaked units.

At any time, the Colossus is able to scale up and down cliffs, one height level at a time, with relative ease and speed. This increased mobility makes the Colossus an even greater threat than simply as an army supporter in a large battle. Using Cliff Walk a single Colossus, or even a group, can move more easily into a flanking position, allowing their splash damage attack to do even greater against an unprepared opponent. Similarly, Cliff Walk can be used in order to utilize the Colossus in a harassment role, allowing it to climb into the opponent's main base and wreak havoc on a potentially unsuspecting mineral line. In either case, Cliff Walk is a means of allowing the Colossus to get to nearly any place on the map. Offensively the Colossus can move in for a flank or sneak attack, while defensively it allows a quick retreat in which most enemies will not be able to pursue. Because this ability is passive the player never will have to activate it, and it does not need to be researched.\n\n## Other\n\nCliff Walk once was an ability of the Science Vessel in the alpha stages of StarCraft 1.

{"document": "# Triple Proxy Barracks\n## Basic Build Order\n### Notes\n\nWhen you build the 3 Barracks, make sure that they aren't in range of a Watchtower's vision range, and that they are out of the way of the normal scouting path for your opponent. Generally you want to build the Barracks quite close to your base, so you can float them over when you've stopped the aggression. When you build the Bunker, you may need to build a 'train' of them up to your opponent's Hatchery. Try and build the 1st Bunker out of sight  of your opponent's Overlords, so he can't try and cancel it by attacking it with Drones. On some maps you can wall off the front of your opponent's natural with 3 Bunkers, denying the natural base until your opponent can make enough Banelings and Zerglings to bust through. Remember that the further forward you build the Barracks, the earlier you need to pull SCVs. Don't just blindly follow this build, use it as a guide and refine it until it works for you.\n\nAgainst a Protoss, you need to be diligent when scouting, because if he is going for a 2 Gate Adept Harass or any other kind of early aggression, you may need to just float your Barracks back and expand.

Use your 2 unit warp-in at ~6:00 to warp 2 Stalkers in to defend your mineral line against Banshees and Hellions. Remember to actually put the Stalkers in the mineral line because it's going to be really annoying if Hellions drop somewhere you do not expect and get free shots whilst your Stalkers walk over to defend. Build Pylons at the normal times, but be sure to spread them out to spot incoming Medivac drops/Banshees. Make sure that you send a Probe to monitor the Terran's natural expansion and Chrono Boost out 2 Observers as soon as your Robotics Facility finishes.\n\nTake your third gas after getting your Robotics Facility running and continue warping-in Stalkers and Zealots. You want to prioritize Stalkers as gas allows until you have about ~6 for harassment defence. After ~6 Stalkers you want to favor Zealots as they are better for defeating the eventual 1/1/1 push. Keep 3 Stalkers in each mineral line with an Observer until the push comes. Get 3 more Gateways (total of 5) and cut Probe production entirely when you reach ~38 workers.\n\nIf it's a normal 1/1/1 with Tanks, get an Immortal after getting 2 Observers and then spend your next 200 Gas on a Robotics Support Bay. Having a Colossus is important for beating late all-ins at ~12:30 or later because the Marine ball will get too big with too little surface area to beat it consistently with just Zealots, Force Fields and Guardian Shield. If the push leaves earlier, you can just cancel the Robotics Support Bay to get out a couple of extra units. Pull some Probes off of gas as you'll mostly need Zealots from this point on.\n\nIf it's a 2 Starport Banshee all-in, get a Forge and a Stargate. Cannon the crap out of the front of your natural, get some Phoenixes, and then get a Robotics Support Bay if they are just chilling outside your natural expansion.

During any battles that you decide to fight your army needs to be presplit, with Infestors and Queens under or slightly behind the Brood Lord wall to avoid Feedbacks. When the Protoss army approaches, throw down a thin(ish) wall of Infested Terrans - remember you don't want to spend too much energy on this, only enough to take away some fire - and make sure that everything is attacking. In these fights, the Zerg player is forced to manually select units and micro them away or forward for specific spells. This is what the professionals do in late game engagement; you can try to copy as much of it as possible, however don't overwhelm yourself. When fighting these late game engagements, it is imperative to keep an eye on the position of your opponent's Mothership. A single, well-placed Vortex can capture your all your Infestors, Corruptors, and/or Brood Lords, instantly swinging the fight into the Protoss player's favor. The presplit minimizes the probability that your opponent will be able to land a good Archon Toilet on your Brood Lords, and always make sure to position your Infestors as far away from the Mothership as possible or keep it rooted far away via Fungal Growth. As long as your units are pre-split and you're spamming Fungal Growth and Infested Terrans along with some Transfuse, you should win the fight. If you're feeling particularly bold, you can try to land a few Neurals on your opponent's Colossus or Mothership.", "question": "In late game engagements against Protoss in StarCraft II, what is the recommended position for your Infestors and Queens during a battle to avoid Feedbacks?", "options": ["Behind the Brood Lord wall", "In front of the Brood Lord wall", "Beside the Brood Lord wall", "Mixed within the Brood Lord wall"], "answer": "Behind the Brood Lord wall"}

{"document": "# Adel's Late Gas (vs. Protoss)\n## Execution\n### Timing Attack\n\nOnce you headed off at about 4:40 to 4:50, you should rally your two Chrono-Stalkers onto your four Zealots. This way your Zealots should arrive at the enemy base before you Stalkers do, though your Stalkers will arrive as soon as possible. Adelscott usually hits the enemy base about 30 seconds with the Zealots before the Stalkers arrive. Once inside the enemy base your goal is to deal as much economic damage as possible. If you can kill off his only Stalker and proceed to wipe out Probes, that would be more beneficial than going straight into the Probe line allowing the Stalker to pick off your units. You need to make quick decisions on whether or not to focus down key Pylons (perhaps powering three or four Warpgates), kill off their army and then their probes, or just focus down the enemy Probes ignoring the current enemy army. This may take some practice, and it will help if you study some of Adelscott's decision making and mimic his play.\n\nIdeally you will want to end up with a clear Probe count lead, resulting in the capability to both hold your expansion and eventually out-produce and overcome an opponent that tries to 4 Warpgate you to death.", "question": "In the described Adel's Late Gas strategy against Protoss, what is the recommended order for your units to attack the enemy base?", "options": ["Zealots first, then Stalkers", "Stalkers first, then Zealots", "Zealots and Stalkers simultaneously", "Stalkers only, no Zealots"], "answer": "Zealots first, then Stalkers"}
{"document": "# Xel'Naga Caverns\n## Taking the Third\n\nThere are usually 3 choices for your third. A. The Gold, which is closer to your opponent. B. the expo behind the rocks and C. the Expo on the right, or left side which has the ramp facing your main.\n\nProtoss will either take the Gold or expo B. If they take the Gold, they will leave the Rocks leading to the other Expo unharmed. So there is only the one flank Possibility behind the Bushes. This area can be walled off with Pylons. Having the main army in the middle of the map, the opponent bases are pressured more.\nIf they take the Expo behind the Rocks, they will destroy the rocks. The mineral line is a bit more vulnerable to drops, because of the High Ground behind it and Protoss will have 2 entrances to defend. The one to the natural and the one to the 3rd. Protoss often build some Cannons at the Third.\n\nTerran almost always takes the Gold as a third and turn the Command Center into a Planetary Fortress. Thus, the expansion is very safe, the opponent will try to avoid the range of the PT. From this very strong Position the Terran can do a slow tank push, or Poke with MMM.\n\nZerg may have a hard time defending the Gold, because of the use of the Xel'Naga Tower with siege tank, supported with a PT in the back, or Protoss Colossus pressure.  There are possible flanks, but a nice arc of Zerg is hard, if pressured by a slow push to the Gold.\nIf they expo at C, both expos have a close air distance to the main, so drops will usually  go for the expos and not the main, and if, they will be spotted early.\nThe B expo is furthest away from the opponent.

{"document": "# Antiga Shipyard\n## Strategy\n### ZvZ\n\n\"Deciding where to send your first Overlord is a bit tricky, there are several tradeoffs you have to make. I opt to send it towards a natural for a couple of reasons:\n\n- Faster to determine if your opponent fast expanded\n\n- Constant vision of any units leaving the base\n\n- In case of a fast expand it's easy to scout  if 1 or 2 queens are in production\n\nThe downside is not knowing the exact timing the gas and spawning pool were put down. These are easy to figure out if you scout a main first. The second overlord can take a small detour to check for an enemy overlord (to determine location), then head towards the center to spot for incoming attacks.\n\nGetting from one main to another takes long enough to nullify any threat a 10pool or 7pool may pose on a standard 14gas14pool build. These aggressive builds make sense only if you're certain you're facing a fast expand and you're willing to go all-in. Antiga Shipyard is a great map for fast expands, so it may pay off to all-in every now and again.\n\nYour natural is very close to your ramp, making it fairly easy to defend a fast expansion with roaches. The better you can create walloffs and tight funnels, the more cost efficient your Roaches will be when facing Zergling aggression.\n\nMid and lategame Zerg vs. Zerg plays out similarly to Tal'Darim Altar. Mutalisk transitions give you a lot of map control and Ultralisk/Infestor is the endgame goal, decimating roach armies when engaged in the open.\"", "question": "What is the main advantage of sending your first Overlord towards your opponent's natural in a ZvZ game on Antiga Shipyard?", "options": ["To determine if your opponent has fast expanded", "To scout the enemy's gas and spawning pool timing", "To create a wall-off and tight funnel for defense", "To transition into Mutalisk mid-game"], "answer": "To determine if your opponent has fast expanded"}
{"document": "# Dimaga's 2 Hatch 5 Roach Econ Build (vs. Terran)\n## Overview\n### Goal\n\nThe goal of this build is to get your fast expo (crucial as Zerg), but defend using Roaches instead of Zerglings. Zerglings are not very good against Marines, Hellions, or Reapers and are very Larva intensive, and every Larva could be a Drone, so Roaches are a good choice for early defense. Once the Roaches are up, you have a couple Zerglings for scouting, allowing you to either Drone and tech or build more Roaches and crush any early pushes that may be coming out.\n\nThe pros of this build are that they get a Lair and a great econ up quite easily and shut down most early harassment.\nThe cons are that it is very timing intensive and it is extremely hard to execute the perfect macro required.", "question": "In the context of Dimaga's 2 Hatch 5 Roach Econ Build, why are Roaches preferred over Zerglings for early defense against Terran?", "options": ["Roaches are faster than Zerglings.", "Roaches are better against Marines, Hellions, or Reapers compared to Zerglings.", "Roaches are cheaper to produce than Zerglings.", "Roaches can be produced without the need for Drones."], "answer": "Roaches are better against Marines, Hellions, or Reapers compared to Zerglings."}

This is very important because it allows you to decide when to Drone or use the Larvae to make the necessary units to counter their army. It also allows you to not waste Larvae on either unnecessary or ineffective units. Zerg will be much better off knowing when that inevitable Terran push is getting ready to move out.\n\n- Use Overseers to drop Changelings on and around Siege Tanks to cause them to shoot themselves and other friendly units with their splash damage.

{"document": "# Mental Checklist\n## Goal\n\nThe goal is plain and simple: Get better Mechanics!\n\nBefore you start with the MCL you have to train using Hotkeys and Control Groups first. But most players use them from the beginning. If you do not ... start!\n\nIn his first video Day[9] explains how important timings are. If you talk about \"timings\" you think of \"timing push\". Cloaked Banshees at 7:16 or four stalkers at 5:42 (4 Warpgate Rush), but Day[9] also means simple timings. If your Marine is about to be finished, it is \"time\" to build the next one. If your Queen gets 25 energy, it's \"time\" to inject Larva.\n\nThe most simple way to do this: Check your food before and after an attack. Both players are at 100? Fine. You killed 10 Drones with Hellions? Even better. But even more important are simple benchmarks. If you play 1 Rax FE, you can have 50 SCVs at the 10-minute-mark. This is a simple benchmark. If you play against a Very-Easy-AI this should be no problem, if you practice enough.\n\nThis statement is often completely ignored by low league players. They will go to a forum and say: \"Opening XY does not work anymore. When I attack my opponent with Roaches at 10:30, he was able to defend it.\"\n\nA Master player who taught this strategy had 29 Roaches at 10:30, our low league player had 10. Benchmarks!\n\nIt's very important you create some kind of benchmark using the MCL. It could be your SCV count, could be your Inject (a Queen's energy).\n\nIn lower leagues you see players watching fights, forgetting to macro at all. The MCL is a way to concentrate on things, where your concentration is really needed. You check\n\n- SCV is building ... good\n\n- Marine is not building ... bad\n\nand we press A to build a Marine.\n\nSo you check your production and execute a command at the right time.\n\nDay[9] compares his MCL to a video about workouts. To train the MCL is really hard and you should take a break, if you are mentally \"out of breath\". Train the MCL constantly!

In fact, the only greedier build would be a CC Rax CC build. CC Rax Gas relies on getting a very strong mineral economy set up as fast as possible in order to support Hellion harass/defense while powering up your infrastructure for the mid game. While a Reaper FE demands the correct reaction in terms of decision making and micro from the Zerg; the CC Rax Gas opening will demand solid macro and a robust mid game from your Zerg opponent. If you feel that your strengths are in the mid game and not the early game, this is the opening for you. It is surprisingly easy to hold this opening against aggressive Zerg play as long as a few critical things are kept in mind.\n\nYour first decision when executing this opening is where to put the Command Center, either in your natural or as part of your wall-off in your main: Both have advantages and disadvantages. Some players use a scout timing to decide (outlined in next paragraph) and others make it as a meta (out-of-game) decision. As your first buildings are constructing, you will have to take extra care to protect your initial SCVs from Drone harass. Right click an SCV onto any Drone that is either inside your main or in your natural if opting for a low ground Command Center. If a Drone finds your Command Center as it is building, you need to send two SCVs from your main into your natural. Tell one SCV to attack the Drone and have the other SCV take over building of the Command Center while sending the damaged SCV back to your main to mine. While somewhat intricate, you will become extremely apt at this maneuver if you do this opening often.\n\nThere are several accepted scout timings to choose from when opening CC first. On two player maps, some players opt to scout after their Supply Depot is done to see if they can build a low ground CC (spot a Hatch first, build low ground CC), or high ground (against 10 pool). The more normal timing is to scout at 16 or 17 with the goal of checking on the Zerg's gas. If the Zerg player does go for gas, check for a third base at the six minute mark. If you do not see a third base you should leave the SCV outside of his natural to spot incoming Speedling or Roach attacks. Some players choose to scout after Orbitals have been started just to determine the starting location of the Zerg on a four player map. These same players would not scout at all on a two player map.\n\nOnce you have completed the Barracks, you will be making two Marines before starting a Reactor. These Marines should be enough to stop any slow Zergling aggression. If the Zerg player decides to send six slow Zerglings to your natural before Hellions are out, you will need to either use a few SCVs in conjunction with the Marines or - if the Marines are damaged or killed before SCVs can join - pull back into your main. If the Zerg decides to poke with eight or more Zerglings and you opted for a late Bunker, you are in trouble. Be careful when cutting corners with Bunker timings.", "question": "In the CC Rax Gas build, at which supply level should you start building a Refinery?", "options": ["10", "14", "15", "16"], "answer": "16"}

{"document": "# Bio (vs. Protoss)\n## Positioning and micro\n\nYou need to be careful about where to engage. You will face the difficult decision of what type of formation to take - if you clump your units together, you'll be able to deal with Zealots more easily, but if you spread them out, chances are Psi Storm and Colossi will be less effective. How spread out your army will need to be is something you'll mostly have to experiment with and adjust depending on your opponent's unit composition - the less Zealots he has, the more spread out your army can be.\n\nA few simple rules can easily be applied:\n\n- Engage the Protoss when most of your troops are shooting, not just a few at the front; otherwise retreat and reposition the army.\n\n- Do not charge into small choke points unless you know the Protoss has no Colossi nearby or Storms available.\n\n- A wide arc/concave will benefit you.\n\nIn some situations the Protoss will be careless enough not to have an Observer in their army. Use a Scanner Sweep before engaging. If you see your opponent does not have an Observer, you can cloak a few Ghosts and EMP as many High Templars and Sentries as possible before attacking.\n\nThe first focus of a big battle should be to distract as many Zealots and Stalkers as possible and surgically take out High Templar and Colossi with whatever has enough firepower to do so:\n\n- Zealots: Move into feint and attack then run away from the opponent's Colossi/High Templar and the Zealots will follow allowing at least a few to be killed off.\n\n- Stalkers: Move in Ghosts in to attack the Colossi respectively. While distracting the splash units attack the Stalker numbers with everything else.\n\n- High Templar/Sentry: Scan the opponent's army and kill off any Observer with them.

{"document": "# Scouting\n## Studying the Metagame\n\nThe act of scouting occurs before the game even begins by researching possible enemy builds. Doing this research will increase the effectiveness of scouting and improve your ability to counter the enemy. Studying the Metagame and knowledge about Build Orders, will not only make it easier to scout and identify your opponent's build, it will make it easier what to scout and when to scout. Doing so will increase the effectiveness of scouting and improve your ability to counter the enemy. Knowing almost all possible builds of your enemy will not only show you what he has right now, but what your opponent will have in a few minutes from then.\n\nLook in the Strategy section of Liquipedia for each of the three races (Terran Strategy, Protoss Strategy, Zerg Strategy) and read all of the major builds the enemy is likely to perform against you. Try not only to understand the basic build order but also the unit composition and the idea behind the build itself. In most builds, you will want to scout your opponent at around 10 to 15 consumed supply - it's during this time the enemy should have made his first tech choice. Determine beforehand what the enemy should have at this point for each build. Doing so will help you understand weaknesses and possible alterations to standard build orders.\n\nIf you are in a higher league, you can use Replay Websites and check out the replays or google for your favorite player (Replays). Download 5 to 10 replays which contain your main race (3 from each of your possible match-ups is best). Notice the build orders each player uses. Watch how the professionals execute their build order and timings against the opponent. Actively participate in watching the replay.

It requires a Cybernetics Core before it can be warped in. The Stargate produces the Phoenix, Oracle and the Void Ray, and after the Fleet Beacon is completed, the Stargate can also warp in the Carrier and the Tempest. The Stargate is one of very few structures that displays a distinctive animation depending on which unit is currently under production -- this means that enemy scouts are able to see what type of unit is about to appear.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Stargate can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. It can only produce units while it remains within the Matrix, otherwise it becomes unpowered and cannot function.\n\n| Unit | Minerals: | Vespene Gas: | Supply: | Build Time: | Key |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phoenix | 150 | 100 | 2 | 25 | X |\n| Oracle | 150 | 150 | 3 | 37 | E |\n| Void Ray | 250 | 150 | 4 | 43 | V |\n| Tempest | 250 | 175 | 5 | 43 | T |\n| Carrier | 350 | 250 | 6 | 64 | C |\n\n## Competitive Use\n\nStargate-based play is an option at all stages of competitive matchups. Phoenixes and Void Rays are used in several rush strategies, for example.  The Void Ray is often deployed alongside a Colossus-based army to provide additional anti-air support along with helping the Colossus to destroy enemy structures in the later stages of the game.\n\nStill, Stargate units are considered slightly riskier to deploy when compared to Robotics Facility units. In part, the lack of a mobile detector unit at the Stargate restricts the viability of early- or mid-game armies centered around Stargate units. Additionally, the Carrier is considered too slow and expensive to be a viable alternative to the Colossus in most matchups.\n\nHowever, due to the expectation that a Robotics Facility is the likely Protoss option in the early- and mid-game, a Protoss player can sometimes gain the element of surprise by instead choosing to use the Stargate (especially if the Stargate is hidden from enemy scouts).\n\n### Heart of the Swarm\n\nIn Heart of the Swarm, Stargate openers are much more common and can in turn go into a completely new unit composition. In 2013 WCS Korea Season 1 Code S Round of 32, Creator used a Stargate Protoss composition against his Zerg opponent, Crazy. In 2012–2013 Proleague: Round 4, Stork uses almost exclusively Stargate units against another Zerg player, hyvaa.[1] Airtoss was also favored as a response to Swarm Hosts. In the end of Heart of the Swarm, after nerfs to the Swarm Host, the focus came back to Immortal/Sentry/Colossus based armies.\n\nOracles are commonly used in openings against both Terran and Protoss and can be effective harassment due to their high damage output, sometimes being proxied to be close to the opponent's base.\n\n### Legacy of the Void beta\n\nIn Legacy of the Void, Stargate openings gained focus again. Air Units are important in PvT to counter early Liberators, and the Carriers are more used as a result of their lower warp-in time, and of their new ability, Release Interceptors.", "question": "Which Protoss structure is required to be built before a Stargate can be warped in?", "options": ["Nexus", "Cybernetics Core", "Robotics Facility", "Forge"], "answer": "Cybernetics Core"}

{"document": "# Antiga Shipyard\n## Strategy\n### ZvT\n\n\"Antiga Shipyard is a fairly decent map for 2rax play. The mains are far apart, but the naturals are close enough to put marine pressure and the barracks can later be used to wall off an expansion. I'm usually a fan of Speedling openers when chances are a 2rax is coming my way, but on this map it's better to bite the bullet and go for a fast Hatchery. Because Terran can either wall off or defend his expansion from a bunker next to his ramp, Speedlings won't delay his expansion long enough to even out the game.\n\nDeciding on a strategy will depend on your spawning locations. While a fast Mutalisk opening does fairly well on any location, relying on just roach ling to fend off midgame tank pushes will be difficult if you spawn with your 3rd facing the Terran player. The distance to the ramp at your 3rd is short, it is difficult to get a surround, difficult to get creep spread and if that wasn't enough, tanks can hit the geyser at your 3rd while chilling in the main. Yeah. Don't go Roach/Ling and expand to your regular 3rd.\nIf you want to delay Mutalisks or skip them altogether on these positions, a good choice is to throw down an extra hatch in your main instead of taking an early third base. Then get a large amount of Roach Ling Baneling. It's a unit composition that does very well against Terran in open spaces. From there on you're in a position to either attack the Terran if he's going for an early 3rd base, or to grab the gold base in the middle of the map.\n\nYou can either aim for an Infestor Ultralisk combo in the lategame, or transition from Mutalisk play into Broodlords. Staying on lair tech for the duration of the game can work, but I feel it's a little too easy to keep 3 bases defended against the type of aggression lair play relies on.\"", "question": "In the context of Zerg versus Terran (ZvT) on the Antiga Shipyard map, why is it advised against expanding to the regular third base when your spawning location is facing the Terran player?", "options": ["The third base is too close to the Terran's main base.", "The distance to the ramp at your third is short, making it difficult to get a surround and defend against tank pushes.", "The Terran player will have too many Mutalisks to handle.", "The Zerg player will not have enough minerals to expand."], "answer": "The distance to the ramp at your third is short, making it difficult to get a surround and defend against tank pushes."}

The Twilight Council enables research of the Charge, Blink and Resonating Glaives upgrades. It also unlocks the Templar Archives and Dark Shrine structures, which in turn unlock the High Templar and Dark Templar units, respectively. Additionally, the Twilight Council is a requirement for the second and third Protoss Ground Weapons, Ground Armor and Shields upgrades at the Forge.\n\nLike most Protoss structures, the Twilight Council can only be warped in at a location powered by the Psionic Matrix. It can only research upgrades while it remains within the Matrix, otherwise it becomes unpowered and cannot function. However, even an unpowered Twilight Council still meets the prerequisites for all of the upgrades and buildings it unlocks.\n\n## Competitive Use\n\nTwo strategies require players to get the Twilight Council at specific, carefully timed moments in a build order. Firstly, as the Twilight Council researches three powerful abilities for the basic gateway units, its construction affects the timing of the first upgrade for the Protoss army, which is critically important in a competitive match. An early Twilight Council lends itself to Timing Attack or rush strategies, for example taking advantage of an early Blink upgrade, to allow for surprise hit-and-run attacks with Stalkers which can bypass ramps. Alternatively, the Resonating Glaives upgrade makes the Adept much more effective against light units, like workers, Zerglings, or Marines. (As of Patch 4.11.0, Charge no longer adds damage on impact, leading to less of a power spike, so getting it first is less common.)\n\nSecondly, the Dark Templar Rush similarly takes advantage of an early Twilight Council to unlock the Dark Shrine for an early stealth attack with the permanently cloaked Dark Templar, intended to hit at an inconvenient timing for the enemy.\n\nEven if other tech structures are warped in first, in longer matches the Twilight Council is still important because it unlocks key technologies for the Protoss late game. For example, at that stage Charge becomes important because it makes Zealots an efficient means of spending minerals, as well as enabling them to be more effective at harassing enemy workers. Additionally, unlocking the Templar Archives for warp-in helps research the Psionic Storm ability earlier, so the sooner a Twilight Council is finished, the sooner that ability can be completed also.

You can counter this in two possible ways:\n\n- Land your Rax earlier, use a Marine or two to force units to move or be killed\n\n- Use your SCV group to attack units in order to either distract them, or simply kill them to enable you to land\n\nRebuilding\n\nPlayers who encounter this build are likely to just spend all available resources on getting any low-tier units in a futile attempt to destroy the Fortress.  However, a simple counter to this build is to save up 400 minerals and rebuild a new Command Center/Nexus elsewhere. This effectively counters the Fortress Rush - though it is quite likely that both players will be on an even footing - the attacking Terran will have little resources, a low SCV count and barely any Marines - but the opponent Terran/Protoss will be in almost the same position.\n\nClustering\n\nA Terran or Protoss who \"clusters\" buildings may make landing the Command Center hard - that is, placing Supply Depots or Pylons in spaced positions that do not allow the large amount of space required to land the Command Center.

{"document": "# Campaign/Cutthroat\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n\nThere are a limited number of harvestable minerals on this map, so most of your income will have to come from gathering salvage, which appear all over the map, and are marked by small white boxes on the minimap. Orlan's forces are also scattered all over the map, and they rarely attack your encampment. Don't panic if Orlan overtakes you in mineral count. Once you destroy his 3 revealed Command Centers and SCVs, his mineral gathering rate will decrease dramatically.\n\nYou start off in the 3 o'clock position of the map, and you have some SCVs, and some Marines to start off with. Start building up your economy, but don't get too many SCVs as your opportunities to actually gather minerals are limited. Orlan has three Command Centers around the map where SCVs gather resources for him, so you'll want to take those out quickly to slow down his mineral gathering rate. You don't need a large attack force to take them down, as they're only lightly guarded.\n\nYou should begin by supplementing your Marines with some Medics, then adding on more Marines, but don't go overboard as you'll want to conserve your minerals for actually hiring Mira Han. Soon after the mission starts, you'll get four Vultures as a present, and you should lay some Spider Mines around your base to stop enemy attacks. Focus on the southern approach, as you'll want to head North first. Get an Engineering Bay and start upgrading your attack. Once you have maybe 8 Marines and 4 Medics, move out to the North, taking down all opposition in your way. Your Vultures should help you to easily take down enemy Marines, and when you get to Orlan's Northern Command Center, take it down. Use your Vultures to gather all the salvage in the area, regroup at home, build some more Marines and Medics, repair your Vultures, and head South.\n\nAttack Orlan's second Command Center, which should also go down easily. Once that goes down, head towards Orlan's third Command Center and destroy that. Once his Command Centers are all destroyed, focus on gathering up as much salvage as you can. Keep your forces together when you enter new areas, as Orlan always has forces lying around. Once you get 6000 minerals, you'll hire Mira Han's troops.\n\nOnce her troops are hired, send your SCVs to harvest minerals at her base, and start building up a larger force. You'll want to focus more heavily on Marauders this time, as Orlan has a few Tanks that will rip through Marines. Supplement your Marauders with Goliaths too, as you'll be meeting a Battlecruiser as well. Try to keep the Mercenary Tanks that Han has alive, as those will help you a lot in assaulting Orlan's base. Once you've amassed a sufficient force, attack Orlan's base. Be sure to stagger your units to avoid Siege Tank splash damage, and if you do you should be able to destroy Orlan's base fairly easily. When you are near Orlan's base, he'll send a nuke. Quickly retreat your forces back otherwise you'll loose a lot of troops from this nuke. Luckily Orlan's forces can also get hit by the nuke if they are in the target area. Even if you should fail, there are enough resources around the map to easily build up a second offensive.\n\nAn easy way to destroy Orlan's Planetary Fortress is to use Siege Tanks from ground level, near where scrap spawns, in Siege mode to hit his Planetary Fortress. The Siege Tanks will have just enough range to hit only needing sight from a scan or a lifted building like a Barracks. This works even on Brutal, but the forces on the high ground will attack the lifted building and the Battlecruiser may go after your tanks. To deal with this make sure to have the rest of your forces there to protect the Siege Tanks and an extra building to give sight if the first one is destroyed.", "question": "In the StarCraft II mission 'Cutthroat', what is the primary source of income for your forces?", "options": ["Minerals from the map", "Salvage from around the map", "Gold from hidden treasures", "Energy crystals from alien structures"], "answer": "Salvage from around the map"}
{"document": "# Campaign/Zero Hour\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n\nYou start in the lower right hand corner of the map, with a well established base. You have enough SCVs to start your economy, but you'll need to add more. You have four Bunkers in total, two at the top of the ramp, and two by the two bridges leading into your base. Unless you are going for the \"Hold the Line\" achievement, it is recommended to salvage your outer bunkers and establish a base defence above the ramp. This is because you will have only half the firepower if you split your army. The high ground will also give you a small advantage over the Zerg Roaches and Hydralisks, since they cannot attack your bunkers unless they have high ground vision.\n\nStart pumping Marines and place additional Bunkers as your Marine count grows. Placing Bunkers is almost vital in Hard and Brutal difficulty, in order to protect your Marines from Banelings. Around 5 Bunkers are enough if you are building your defence above the ramp. Medics are very useful if you are planning to go for the \"The Best Defense...\" achievement as well as for saving the rebels. If you need Medics in order to move out, a single Barracks with a Tech Lab will do (build Reactors on the rest of your Barracks). As the rebel groups appears, it is recommended to move out and save them to add more strength to your army. Note that the Zerg has burrowed Zerglings and Hydralisks near each rebel group, so you will need some Marines (and preferably some Medics) to save them.\n\nRemember to constantly make more SCVs until you have around 25 of them, build additional Barracks as your economy grows, and keep around 3 SCVs near your Bunkers to repair (also use these SCVs to build Supply depots, since they often stand idle). Simply reinforce your forces constantly and be prepeared to defend your SCVs from small Zergling drops in your base and you should be able to survive the 20 minutes.\n\nIf you're looking to get the \"The Best Defense...\" achievement, try to attack the two nearest Hatcheries on the south part of the map as soon as possible, since the strength of the Zerg attacks increase constantly. Your initial attack should start before the timer hits 8 minutes. Consider leaving your base right after you have destroyed an attack wave, and leave a few Marines in your Bunkers, (now might be a good time to send some extra SCVs to auto repair the Bunkers as well). Once you reach the Hatcheries, try to focus fire them down as fast as possible while killing of the spawning Zerg.

The map throws out the conventional main-nat setup in favor of a setup where the main and natural effectively become one continuous base. This setup is very clearly inspired by the BW map Katrina. The BW inspiration doesn't stop there, as the aesthetics are the Jungle tileset from BW reconstructed in SC2. Measures have been taken to limit the vulnerability of the backdoor into the natural to certain cheese strategies. Beyond the main-nat players must make careful decisions about how they expand. There is no clearly preferred third base nor is there a clearly prefered fourth. These decisions will depend on the race and the strategies that the player is using.\n\n## Official Map Description\n\nTeamLiquid map contest finalist.\n\nCreated by Semmo.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n## Strategies\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Bridgehead515122596348.4%159887155.3%68343450.0%4022104\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Bridgehead | 515 | 122 | 59 | 63 | 48.4% | 159 | 88 | 71 | 55.3% | 68 | 34 | 34 | 50.0% | 40 | 22 | 104 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2015-11-012015-11-072015 WCS Global Finals2015-09-242015-09-252015 Dream\nHack Open: Stockholm2015-08-132015-09-132015 WCS Season 3 Premier League2015-08-302015-08-31\nMSI Masters Gaming Arena 20152015-08-052015-08-09\nIEM Season X - gamescom2015-07-162015-07-19\nIEM Season X - Shenzhen2015-07-162015-07-172015 Dream\nHack Open: Valencia2015-07-062015-07-12\nLOTTE Homeshopping 2015 Ke\nSPA Cup Season 22015-07-022015-07-05\nHome\nStory Cup XI\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015-11-01 | 2015-11-07 |  | 2015 WCS Global Finals |\n| 2015-09-24 | 2015-09-25 |  | 2015 DreamHack Open: Stockholm |\n| 2015-08-13 | 2015-09-13 |  | 2015 WCS Season 3 Premier League |\n| 2015-08-30 | 2015-08-31 |  | MSI Masters Gaming Arena 2015 |\n| 2015-08-05 | 2015-08-09 |  | IEM Season X - gamescom |\n| 2015-07-16 | 2015-07-19 |  | IEM Season X - Shenzhen |\n| 2015-07-16 | 2015-07-17 |  | 2015 DreamHack Open: Valencia |\n| 2015-07-06 | 2015-07-12 |  | LOTTE Homeshopping 2015 KeSPA Cup Season 2 |\n| 2015-07-02 | 2015-07-05 |  | HomeStory Cup XI |", "question": "On the Bridgehead map, how does the base setup differ from conventional maps in StarCraft II?", "options": ["The main and natural bases are separated by a large distance.", "The main and natural bases effectively become one continuous base.", "There are no natural bases available for players.", "The natural base is fortified with additional defenses."], "answer": "The main and natural bases effectively become one continuous base."}

{"document": "# Zerg Regeneration\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Zerg Regeneration mechanic is a permanent, passive attribute of all Zerg units and buildings. It allows an injured Zerg unit or structure to fully regenerate its health. Once damage is done to a Zerg unit, it begins to regenerate health, unlike Protoss Plasma Shields, which require 10 seconds of no combat activity.\n\n### Details\n\n- Health regenerates at a rate of 0.38 points per game second.\n\n- Zerg units and structures begin to regenerate health the instant damage is taken.\n\n- The instant start to regeneration allows Zerg units and structures to survive spells that would otherwise kill it.\n\n- For example, prior to patch 3.11.0, a full-health Hydralisk will survive a single full Psionic Storm, even though it is an 80 HP unit taking 80 damage.\n\n## In Combination with Spells\n\n- Roaches regenerate health at an accelerated rate (7 Hit Points per second) while Burrowed, due to Rapid Regeneration.\n\n- Mutalisks regenerate health faster (1.4 Hit Point per second) due to Tissue Regeneration.\n\n## Other\n\n- Units don't regenerate health at an increased rate when on Creep, a possible misconception during and prior to the StarCraft II beta.\n\n- Zerg regeneration of structures continues even when the structure is not supported by creep. The structure loses health at a net rate of 3.82 health per second, linearly (the combination of 4.2 hps loss and 0.38 hps regeneration).", "question": "What is the health regeneration rate per game second for Zerg units and buildings?", "options": ["0.38 points", "1.4 points", "7 points", "10 points"], "answer": "0.38 points"}
{"document": "# Sight\n## General\n\nSight or Vision is an attribute of units and structures that allows players on the same team to see enemy units or structures, or to reveal things through the Fog of War. Every unit or building provides vision of a certain distance, and this vision continues to be provided for a brief time after the unit or structure blinks, is warped, or is destroyed. Areas with sight or vision are shown on the minimap as well as the main window.  Units which are provided sight are able to attack units that they could not see on their own.\n\nGround units cannot see up cliffs. A scan will also reveal highground terrain.\n\nDetection is a separate ability. Although detection is tied to a unit's sight range, it will provide detection within that range when its own line of sight is blocked by terrain or sight blockers as long as vision is provided by another unit. The Radar ability of the Sensor Tower works slightly differently from Sight. It shows the player the position of enemy units as symbols, but not the unit type or allow them to be attacked. The Oracle's Revelation provides the Protoss temporary 1-range vision around its targets. The Observer & Overseer have abilities that increase their sight range by 25% at the cost of immobilizing them.\n\nThe Tempest and the Siege Tank (in Siege Mode)  are notable for having an attack Range longer than their Sight range. For these units to attack at maximum range, some other unit or ability must be used to grant vision of the target. The range of the Liberator in Defender Mode with Advanced Ballistics is also longer than its sight, but it receives vision of its targeted area.", "question": "Which unit or structure provides a temporary 1-range vision around its targets, aiding in revealing enemy positions?", "options": ["Tempest", "Oracle", "Observer", "Siege Tank"], "answer": "Oracle"}

{"document": "# Colossus (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### General\n\nThe Colossus is a heavy support unit that deals large amounts of damage over a moderately sized area (2.8 width, 0.3 depth). The massive battle strider is capable of obliterating large amounts of light ground forces within seconds.\n\nThe Legacy of the Void version of the Colossus does less damage in general than earlier versions of the unit. In return for +1 base range (though the same total with Extended Thermal Lance) and greater attack speed, its base damage was reduced. It does bonus damage against light units, and thus can be effective against massed light units such as Marines, Zerglings, and Zealots.\n\nBecause of their damage reduction and other new units in the meta, the Immortal has succeeded the Colossi as the premier Anchor unit of the Robotics Facility. Versus Zerg, the Ravager's Corrosive Bile destroys forcefields, removing the most important tool when supporting Colossus armies, and Lurkers can stall these walkers long enough to tech to the many counters against them. Alongside that, Lurkers rip the standard complementary gateway unit to Colossi, the Stalker, which would otherwise normally provide anti-armor and anti-air. In PvP Disruptors have become the primary form of splash damage because they have the ability to blow up Protoss units in less hits, are cheaper than Archons, and don't need any upgrades to achieve damage. Therefore it is only against Terran now where Colossi are most suitable, providing consistent splash that Marine micro cannot mitigate.\n\nResearching Extended Thermal Lance remains standard in all match-ups if Colossi are to be built, as the upgrade grants it longer range than most other ground units, allowing it to fire from a safe distance. It is only outranged by the Terran Siege Tank in its immobile Siege Mode and the Zerg Lurker with Seismic Spines. Along with Cliff Walk, this allows the Colossus to kite ground units using the terrain to its advantage. Most ground units will not be able to pursue correctly managed Colossi without taking high amounts of damage or simply dying.\n\nThe Colossus's main weakness is its additional vulnerability to air attacks. Vikings, Corruptors, and Tempests deal bonus damage to Massive or Armored units, both of which apply to the Colossus. As Air units can easily flank the Protoss army, they may circumvent the Protoss anti-air and destroy the powerful Colossi without risk. A Colossus-heavy army needs to be bolstered with appropriate numbers of anti-air support, in order to combat aerial threats.\n\nThere are a few units with different anti-air and anti-ground weapons. Of these, the Tempest, Queen, and Infested Terran will prefer to attack the Colossus with their AA weapon, and the Battlecruiser attacks with its AG weapon. If the Thor engages with its AA weapon (which is longer-range), it will continue attacking with it, but if it begins to engage at low enough range, it prefers its AG weapon.\n\nThe Colossus synergizes well with Sentries and Stalkers. Force fields can be used both to block off and to entrap enemy ground units (allowing for maximized splash damage) while Stalkers provide anti-air support and act as a meat shield (alongside Zealots); the Blink ability may also increase the Stalkers' damage absorption. With its height, the Colossus is able to reveal areas atop cliffs, enabling allied units to fire upwards on to high ground, as well as enabling Stalkers to Blink to targeted locations, which would otherwise be inaccesible. One Colossus fills a Warp Prism.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it is possible to sustain continuous Colossi production out of double Robotics Facilities per mining base, so long as no Chrono Boost is used.", "question": "Which of the following units can out-range a Colossus with the Extended Thermal Lance upgrade in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Zealots", "Vikings", "Siege Tanks in Siege Mode", "Stalkers"], "answer": "Siege Tanks in Siege Mode"}
{"document": "# Attributes\n\nAttributes in Starcraft II are a set of tags that belong to units and buildings that can determine bonus damage on weapons and affect Abilities and Spells. Ground and Air are unit types that determine how a unit can move and which weapons can target it. Detector is a passive ability. Melee and Ranged are damage types on a weapon that can determine whether certain abilities affect it. Attributes are listed with the statistics on the user interface when a single unit is selected.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Attributes are: Light, Armored, Massive, Biological, Mechanical, Psionic, Structure, Heroic.\n\nHeroic applies to specific Campaign units and the Mothership.\n\n### Units & Buildings\n\nMost units have one Attribute from the following pairs:\n\n- All units are either Light or Armored, except the Archon, Ghost, Ravager, Baneling, Queen, and Cocoon, which are neither.\n\n- All units are either Biological or Mechanical, except the Archon and Infested Terran Egg, which are neither, and the SCV and Hellbat, which are both.\n\nAll buildings have the Structure attribute, including the Auto-Turret and Stasis Ward. All buildings except Stasis Ward and Creep Tumor are Armored. All Terran buildings are Mechanical. All Zerg buildings are Biological. No buildings are Psionic, Massive or Heroic.\n\n### Abilities & Weapons\n\nMost weapons with bonus damage only apply that damage to units with specific Attributes, usually Light or Armored. Infernal Pre-Igniter and Mag-Field Accelerator are upgrades that grant bonus damage, as does the ability Prismatic Alignment. Some abilities can only target units with certain attributes. Repair only targets Mechanical units, Steady Targeting only targets Biological units, and Interference Matrix only targets Mechanical and Psionic units. Massive units, on the other hand, counter certain movement-controlling abilities. For example, they cannot be targeted by Graviton Beam. Neural Parasite cannot target Heroic units.", "question": "Which attribute applies to all buildings in StarCraft II, including the Auto-Turret and Stasis Ward?", "options": ["Light", "Armored", "Structure", "Biological"], "answer": "Structure"}

Watch this location closely when army sizes get bigger, while utilizing the wider attack paths.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Two gold bases, once on each side of the map. The closest one is on an island.\n\n- Very short distance to your opponent, with a narrow path and a Xel'Naga watchtower.\n\n## Strategies\n\nUlrena's map design featured very little airspace between the opponent's main bases. This resulted in a multitude of very strong 1-2 base play in all matchups. While Ulrena was unsurprisingly cut out of GSL for it's radical design, it did see a season of play in 2016 Proleague. ByuL popularized the ZvT / ZvP ling-Queen drop, while Korean and foreign professional protoss found much success in PvT with a Tempest rush build created solely for this map. The narrow flight distance also lead to some intense Pylon-rushes, as the Mothership Core was still a key early game unit for protoss at the time. The maps chokes allowed Terrans to experiment with turtle mech focused around Tanks and Thors, or its relatively short rush distance lead to some 5-Rax-Marine or 3-Rax-Reaper all-ins. In addition, the unlikelihood of players travelling far to the right side of the map allowed for some hidden bases and proxied tech, which even trickled up to professional play. For late game, heavy air compositions were common due to the awkwardness of the North-South passages.\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Ulrena135842420022447.2%33017016051.5%1941009451.5%9788225\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Ulrena | 1358 | 424 | 200 | 224 | 47.2% | 330 | 170 | 160 | 51.5% | 194 | 100 | 94 | 51.5% | 97 | 88 | 225 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2016-06-022016-09-112016 StarCraft II Star\nLeague Season 22016-06-232016-06-26\nHome\nStory Cup XIII2016-05-142016-05-162016 WCS Circuit: Spring Circuit Championship2016-05-062016-05-082016 Dream\nHack Open: Austin2016-01-072016-04-092016 StarCraft II Star\nLeague Season 12016-03-212016-03-26\nGold Series International 20162016-03-022016-03-052016 WCS Circuit: Winter Circuit Championship2016-01-222016-01-242016 Dream\nHack Open: Leipzig2015-12-032016-01-03\nNation\nWars III2015-12-172015-12-20\nHome\nStory Cup XII2015-11-262015-11-28\nDream\nHack ROCCAT Lot\nV Championship\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2016-06-02 | 2016-09-11 |  | 2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 2 |\n| 2016-06-23 | 2016-06-26 |  | HomeStory Cup XIII |\n| 2016-05-14 | 2016-05-16 |  | 2016 WCS Circuit: Spring Circuit Championship |\n| 2016-05-06 | 2016-05-08 |  | 2016 DreamHack Open: Austin |\n| 2016-01-07 | 2016-04-09 |  | 2016 StarCraft II StarLeague Season 1 |\n| 2016-03-21 | 2016-03-26 |  | Gold Series International 2016 |\n| 2016-03-02 | 2016-03-05 |  | 2016 WCS Circuit: Winter Circuit Championship |\n| 2016-01-22 | 2016-01-24 |  | 2016 DreamHack Open: Leipzig |\n| 2015-12-03 | 2016-01-03 |  | NationWars III |\n| 2015-12-17 | 2015-12-20 |  | HomeStory Cup XII |\n| 2015-11-26 | 2015-11-28 |  | DreamHack ROCCAT LotV Championship |", "question": "Which strategy was popularized by ByuL on the Ulrena map in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Pylon-rush", "Ling-Queen drop", "Tempest rush", "5-Rax-Marine all-in"], "answer": "Ling-Queen drop"}

{"document": "# Ghost (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs.

Ghosts are also sometimes used to support Bio armies with Steady Target and their 10+10 damage against light units.\n\nIn later stages of the game, it is common to see ghosts as part of a bio army to counter higher-tier Zerg units. Ghosts can use a combination of cloaking and Steady Target against high-value, powerful targets like Brood Lords and Ultralisks. The Zerg must then make it a priority to counter the ghosts, with Infestors often used to attack the grouped ghosts and also revealing them should they be cloaked.\n\nAnother usage of Ghosts in late game is to push back the Zerg player with Nuclear Missiles and have some map presence in late game. Due to the fact that moving out on the map is so dangerous for Terran armies later on, Ghosts make up for this deficiency in this regard.\n\nByuN has popularized Ghost usage against Zerg, notably in his games against Zenio in the GSL with its EMP ability to drain the energy off Infestor to prevent them from getting Fungal Growths off on the Terran bio army.", "question": "What ability of Ghosts is often used to counter high-value Zerg targets like Brood Lords and Ultralisks?", "options": ["Nuclear Missiles", "Steady Target", "EMP", "Cloaking"], "answer": "Steady Target"}

{"document": "# MULE (Legacy of the Void)\n\nMULEUnit Information\nType:Ground Unit\nDescription:Prototype harvesting unit. Gathers minerals more quickly than regular SCVs. MULEs last 64 seconds before their systems fail.Cost: Minerals: 0  Vespene Gas: 0\nUnit stats\nDefense: Hit Points: 60  Armor: 0 (+1)\nAttributes:Light, Mechanical\nSight:8\nSpeed:3.94\n\n## Description\n\nThe Mobile Utility Lunar Excavator (MULE) is a temporary unit that can mine minerals (not gas) and repair for the Terran forces. MULEs are called down from the Orbital Command at the cost of 50 energy. They last 64 seconds. If the MULE is cast on a mineral patch it will begin to mine minerals as soon as it spawns. It takes slightly under 64 seconds for an orbital command to generate 50 energy,[1] meaning that a MULE can be called down at almost the same time as the previous one expires.\n\nDespite their timed life and Orbital Command energy cost, a MULE has several advantages over an SCV. A MULE costs no supply. MULEs have a mining time 2.05x longer than an SCV, but have the same movement speed and acceleration. MULEs carry 5 times more minerals per trip than an SCV on normal minerals, gathering 25 minerals per trip on all types of mineral patches. Their timed life allows 8-9 mining trips which totals 200-225 minerals on any mineral patch. A MULE can mine a mineral patch alongside an SCV thus providing extra income on expansions that are already saturated. However, only one MULE at a time can be harvesting a mineral patch.\n\nMULEs are as effective as around 3.45 SCVs on near patches and 3.94 SCVs on far patches, as SCVs average 61.22 minerals per minute on near blue mineral patches and 53.57 minerals per minute on far blue mineral patches (for two or less workers per patch).\n\nPlease note that MULEs mine the same amount on normal and gold mineral patches.\n\n## Abilities\n\nGather\nOrder workers or MULEs to gather resources from selected mineral field or vespene geyser.\n\nRepair Minerals: * Vespene Gas: *Duration: *SCVs and MULEs can Repair friendly mechanical units and Terran buildings.\n*  Cost and time varies depending on unit.\n\n## Competitive Usage\n\nMULEs can be called down anywhere on the map if the player has vision of the area. There are few instances where doing so in order to scout or repair damaged units would be worth the loss of economy, especially with Scanner Sweep costing the same amount of energy. They can be called down for repairs in the field.\n\nDropping MULEs in your opponent's base can also be used to humiliate a losing opponent, coercing them to concede.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nMULEs are used primarily to keep up with the Protoss' ability to chronoboost probes from the Nexus.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nMULE can be used late game when resources aren't as much of an issue in an \"all out\" type of battle. Call the mules down on enemy tank lines as you move in in order to draw tank fire and allowed enemy tanks to splash damage each other. This is especially good if you can time it right and put that first round of fire from enemy tanks on cool down right as you move in to get that extra edge in the battle. This functions as an expensive Terran version of starcraft:Zealot Bombing.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Griffith 4OC build takes advantages of MULEs by quickly committing to 4 Orbital Commands. The build provides Terran with a fairly significant mid-game economic advantage.\n\n## External links\n\n- The MULE and the Metagame Shift - Article on TeamLiquid.\n\n- Analysis of MULE and SCV use - Article on TeamLiquid.", "question": "How many minerals can a MULE gather per trip on any type of mineral patch?", "options": ["10 minerals", "25 minerals", "50 minerals", "100 minerals"], "answer": "25 minerals"}

Rally in new Hellions as you build them.\n\n- Build the Orbital Command add-on before moving the Command Center out of your base to play safe.\n\n- As you are playing Hellion-heavy, the Pre-Igniter should be the first Tech Lab upgrade you get. Although Hellions are not too effective versus Roaches, you should be able to successfully kite them until Siege Tanks are out.\n\n- This is a good build to transition into full Mech. As you do not need the Barracks for production, float it out to scout and save some scans.\n\n### Scouting\n\nWith proper adaptation into Mech this build should be good versus any non-rush opening. Scout Spawning Pool and Expansion timing to contention and you can even pull the SCV back, save it to repair the Hellions, or use it to delay his expansion. Any one-base builds should be met with delaying the Command Center to prepare proper counter measures.\n\n## Execution\n\nAs you expand you need to keep his forces at bay with your Hellions. Pay attention to his forces and control your Hellions correctly to ensure safe passage of the CC, while ensuring a Siege Tank or Armory/Thor follow-up to fend off the Zerg's next weapon of choice.\n\nAs you are expanding do not be afraid to use a scan and add Hellions/Tanks/Thors as you see fit - making an army composition to counter his.\n\n## Transitioning\n\nMech play is not the only possible way to transition from this build. Instead of a second Factory you can build more Barracks and start Bio production.\n\n## Maps\n\nAs you are initially depending on your wall for defense, a small ramp is really beneficial.

SCVs are capable of placing a Bunker where the typical Zerg Fast Expansion would be to prevent the expansion from taking place. This then forces the Zerg to stay on one base and create attacking units to deal with the bunker placement. Because of the ability to Salvage, Bunkers can be placed and Salvaged when their health is low to recoup 75% of the investment made, meaning only 25 minerals has been lost from the harassment. The Terran also has the choice of allowing the expansion to be made and exploiting the Zerg's economic commitment by building a Bunker close to the expansion to bunker rush their opponent.

{"document": "# Spawn Creep Tumor\n## Use\n\nSee Also: Creep\n\nThe Spawn Creep Tumor is a less prioritised spell of the Queen, as Spawn Larva is more essential, but it is still a commonly used and powerful ability. It is smart to use Spawn Creep Tumor if you have forgotten to use Spawn Larva, so that the extra energy comes to use. Creep Tumors allow Zerg players to extend their Creep, can be used to create Creep 'highways' between expansions for faster reinforcements, spread Creep on key areas of the map that might require Zerg to be more mobile or to bring Spine or Spore Crawlers to a more forward position. This ability can be used in place of the Overlord's Generate Creep ability. Tumors allow Zerg players to Creep up their entire side of the map without the risk of exposing Overlords to fire. Another benefit of this ability is that once a tumor is placed, it can infinitely spread itself by creating new tumors (assuming the 'live' one is not killed) around the map. Once the tumor has finished morphing it becomes cloaked and can only be seen by an opponent who has detection, gives large vision radius and spreads more creep.\nFor faster creep spreading via Tumors, you can use Overlords to Generate Creep at the maximum range of the Tumor so that you do not need to wait for the Creep to spread normally. Multiple Creep Tumors in the same space also have the compounding effects of spreading creep more quickly.", "question": "What is a benefit of using Creep Tumors over Overlords for spreading Creep in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Creep Tumors can spread Creep infinitely without risk of being destroyed.", "Creep Tumors provide a smaller vision radius compared to Overlords.", "Creep Tumors become cloaked once morphed and can spread Creep without being easily seen by the opponent.", "Creep Tumors require more energy to use than Overlords do."], "answer": "Creep Tumors become cloaked once morphed and can spread Creep without being easily seen by the opponent."}
{"document": "# 10 Pylon 10 Gateway Zealot Pressure\n## Zealot Micromanagement\n\n- Zealots are not cost effective against Zerglings in a straight up fight where all Zerglings can attack at once. However, Zealots can utilize mineral patches, gas geysers, walls, cliffs and structures to create artificial chokes and deny surface area to the Zerglings. A Zealot in between two mineral patches becomes a superhero, able to take on many Zerglings/drones for a very long period of time and often deny mining from that patch.\n\n- Despite being melee units, Zealots can still target fire to make themselves more effective in small groups. Target down Zerglings/drones to kill them quicker with 2-3 Zealots that all have access to the same ling, but never force Zealots to move to be able to attack.\n\n- If you find yourself with 3-4 Zealots you can form a line to block the ramp between the Zerg's main and natural on small-choke ramps. Use reinforcing Zealots to attack the natural/spinecrawlers and deny mining while reinforcements from the main are blocked, and hold position the Zealots on the ramp.

{"document": "# High Templar (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\n- High Templar is the most important source of splash damage against Zerg. Storm hits air and ground, as well as affecting all units with the same damage equally. This generalist source of area of effect damage is what makes High Templar stand above the rest. Compared to Colossus and Disruptor they fare better as they do not posses their clear weaknesses and they do not tie up production of another important unit in the Immortal.\n\n- Do note that storm usually isn't meant to be a fatal blow to most units with the exception of Zerglings, Banelings and Drones. What storm is meant to do is weaken enemy units for the rest of your units to finish off. An example is Storm + Immortal vs Hydralisks where storm will lower Hydralisks to a low enough health to where the Immortals can clean up with 1 or 2 hits.\n\n- Against Mutalisk play Storm can be used as an effective zoning tool, however High Templar are vulnerable to being sniped by Mutas. Factor in the speed of Mutas and they can escape storms fairly easily. To this extent units such as Archons, Phoenix and Stalkers fare much better.\n\n- Feedback is only really useful versus Vipers and to an extent Overseers. Infestors are tricky since they are usually kept burrowed and the spell Fungal Growth can be used to catch High Templar attempting to feedback.\n\n- Come late game storm support with a fully maxed out Skytoss fleet of Carriers,Mothership, Tempests or Voidrays with Archons is necessary to be able to stand toe to toe with a fully maxed out late game Zerg swarms. Storm plus Archons is an excellent zoning tool to prevent large Corruptor flocks from diving in and killing valuable capital ships, and with active Voidrays Corruptor swarms will be disintegrated in seconds.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the primary role of a High Templar's Storm ability when used against Zerg Hydralisks?", "options": ["To instantly kill the Hydralisks with a single hit", "To weaken Hydralisks to a point where other units can finish them off", "To completely block the path of Hydralisks and prevent them from moving", "To detect and reveal hidden Hydralisks"], "answer": "To weaken Hydralisks to a point where other units can finish them off"}
{"document": "# Atlantis Spaceship\n\nAtlantis Spaceship\nMap Information\nCreator:LSTileset:Space Platform\nSize:152x152\nSpawn Positions:2 at 1,7\nVersions:1.0\n\nAtlantis Spaceship is a two-player map, created by Team Crux member LSPrime. It was used in the IPL Team Arena Challenge 2 and 2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 2. It continues to be used in the current seasons of those events, IPL Team Arena Challenge 3 and 2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 3.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThis map has one of the largest rush distances in any map pool. This allows for many players to go for greedy expansions and upgrade timings. Some players meta-game this map and do a proxy to punish greedy play by negating the long rush distance. This map has also seen a lot of mech play by Terrans. This map is favorable for mech play as there are a small number of attack paths, depending on which bases you expand to. In addition the long distances in this map allows you to take some map control and reposition your slow army as required. Another common style on this map is air, from all three races. Air play is quite strong as the air distances are much closer than by land, PvX sees Phoenix play, TvX sometimes sees Banshee play, and ZvX also favor Spire play on this map. The more central base with three Vespene Geysers can be sieged from the low ground, however only the extra, rich, Vespene Geyser is at risk.\n\n## Notable Features\n\n- Two bases with a third, rich, Vespene Geyser, this geyser can be sieged from the low-ground behind the Geyser.\n\n- A Xel'Naga tower placed in the middle of the map provides vision for both early aggression and is vital in mid-/lategame positional warfare.\n\nThe map does not call for a single true path of expansion. You can either do it from your main and natural and just continue along the edge of the spaceship - or alternatively take the pocket 3rd and make a cluster with the 3gas-expansion and the 5th close to your main by air.\n\n## Trivia\n\n- Artosis has stated that he does not think this is a very good or balanced map several times during GSL broadcasts.[1]\n\n- If you look at the minimap, you can see a panda bear, his head is in the 10o'clock position.\n\n## Statistics\n\nvs.  vs.  vs. Mirrors\nMap#Σ%Σ%Σ%Atlantis Spaceship413105485745.7%120615950.8%76482863.2%343345\n\n|  | vs. | vs. | vs. | Mirrors |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Map | # | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % | Σ |  |  | % |  |  |  |\n| Atlantis Spaceship | 413 | 105 | 48 | 57 | 45.7% | 120 | 61 | 59 | 50.8% | 76 | 48 | 28 | 63.2% | 34 | 33 | 45 |\n\n### Played in Premier Tournaments\n\nStart date\nEnd date\nTournament2012-08-152012-08-19\nIEM Season VII - Cologne2012-08-022012-08-04\nASUS ROG Summer 20122012-05-282012-07-282012 Global StarCraft II Team League Season 22012-05-212012-07-272012 Global StarCraft II League Season 32012-07-052012-07-08\nHome\nStory Cup V2012-03-102012-05-192012 Global StarCraft II League Season 22012-04-062012-04-08\nIGN Pro\nLeague Season 4\n\n| Start date | End date | Tournament |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012-08-15 | 2012-08-19 |  | IEM Season VII - Cologne |\n| 2012-08-02 | 2012-08-04 |  | ASUS ROG Summer 2012 |\n| 2012-05-28 | 2012-07-28 |  | 2012 Global StarCraft II Team League Season 2 |\n| 2012-05-21 | 2012-07-27 |  | 2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 3 |\n| 2012-07-05 | 2012-07-08 |  | HomeStory Cup V |\n| 2012-03-10 | 2012-05-19 |  | 2012 Global StarCraft II League Season 2 |\n| 2012-04-06 | 2012-04-08 |  | IGN ProLeague Season 4 |\n\n## External links\n\n- Thread on TL.net\n\n- Concept art on TeamCrux\n\n- Atlantis Spaceship games - FPVODs - YouTube playlist\n\n- Season 5 Ladder Map Pool Update", "question": "Which of the following strategies is commonly seen on the Atlantis Spaceship map due to its large rush distances?", "options": ["Proxy strategy", "Rush strategy", "Micro-management strategy", "Macro-economic strategy"], "answer": "Proxy strategy"}
{"document": "# Stutter Step\n\n## Definition\n\nStutter Step is a technique where a unit is ordered to move right as its attack animation starts. This way it will deal damage but instantly start moving again, allowing it to keep up with fleeing units and attack again. This technique is most often employed by Terran players with Marine and Marauder compositions; however it can be used with nearly all ranged units. The only ranged units that do not benefit from Stutter Step micro are those with high rates of fire compared to their acceleration. The Hydralisk is an example of this, where Attack move is most ideal.\n\n## Examples\n\n- qxc's Explanatory Topic + Video\n\n- Updated video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E6MInDwljI\n\n- qxc's Stutter Step Practice Map Download Location", "question": "Which of the following units is an example of a unit that does not benefit from the Stutter Step technique due to its high rate of fire compared to its acceleration?", "options": ["Marine", "Marauder", "Hydralisk", "Zealot"], "answer": "Hydralisk"}
{"document": "# Fungal Growth\n## Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\nIn ZvT, Fungal Growth is extremely effective against bio armies (composed of Marines and Marauders) as well as trapping so-called \"battle mech\" (composed of Hellions and Cyclones).  There are three main reasons for its effectiveness against Barracks armies.  First, it allows the Zerg player to punish Stimpack use by backing off once the bio force is immobile.  This causes the Terran army to take Stimpack damage, combined with Fungal Growth's damage over time.  Second, it holds the Terran army in place, maximizing the damage of splash units like Banelings and Ultralisks, and removing the speed advantage and kiting ability that Stimpack provides.  And third, it gives the Zerg an easy way to burn through Medivac energy.\n\nAgainst certain unit combinations Fungal Growth also provides range control, allowing the Zerg player free damage.  Against a bio army that lacks Siege Tank support, Fungal Growth allows Hydralisks with Grooved Spines to attack with minimal reprisal from the Terran player.  Regrettably the spell loses some of its viability against Mech/Biomech armies because of Siege Tank range and Mech unit health, which causes the Infestor's other spells to take priority.  Against Terran air, Fungal Growth can easily shut down Banshee harassment, and can also be used to annihilate dozens of Vikings combined with Viper's parasitic bombs.  Despite the tendency of Battlecruisers to stack while attacking, their high health limits the damage caused by Fungal Growth.  Fungal Growth can also be used to stop drops before they enter the Zerg base, destroying all loaded units when the Medivac dies.\n\n- Reveals Ghosts and Banshees that are using Cloak.\n\n- Will stop Vikings and Siege Tanks from transforming between their different modes.\n\n- Does not affect a Seeker Missile.", "question": "Which of the following units is NOT affected by Fungal Growth in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Ghosts", "Banshees", "Seeker Missile", "Vikings"], "answer": "Seeker Missile"}

This is a reason why Protoss players do not normally wall against Terrans, who get ranged Marines very early. Similarly, Protoss players can sometimes take advantage of the range of a Void Ray to attack a Terran wall from outside the range of defending Marines.\n\nA wall composed of weaker structures such as Supply Depots or Pylons early on can present a false sense of security, as Zerg players can perform a Baneling Bust to easily break down the wall, leaving the defender with few units to defend against the flood of Zerglings breaching your wall. For this reason, Terran players tend to use Barracks and Factories for their wall as they are much harder to destroy, and can still provide the door function by lifting off. Protoss do not have this advantage and would have to destroy the building (or cancel before it finishes construction) to provide access.\n\nIf your wall of Supply Depots or Pylons is breached, you can become supply blocked, rendering you unable to reinforce or produce more units during the attack.

{"document": "# Marine (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\n- Combat Shielded Marines will survive a fight with a Stimpack-upgraded Marine with 7 HP. Combat Shield also takes less time to research, so in early Marine vs Marine skirmishes, one should not necessarily get the Stimpack upgrade first by default in TvT.\n\n- Against Banshees it is recommended to get at least one Viking or Cyclone, as marines can lack the range and speed to finish off a banshee fleeing from a scan.\n\n- Against Battlecruisers if there are more air armor upgrades than bio attack upgrades, the DPS of the Marines is cut down by a third so it is important to keep upgrading.

The Factory requires a Barracks before it can be built. The Factory can be lifted off and landed elsewhere after it has been constructed.\n\nA Factory is also required before you are able to build a Starport, thus it is a key step in the Terran Tech Tree. It is also required to build a Nuke.\n\n| Unit | Minerals: | Vespene Gas: | Supply: | Build Time: | Key | Tech Lab |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hellion | 100 | 0 | 2 | 21 | E | X |\n| Widow Mine | 75 | 25 | 2 | 21 | D | X |\n| Cyclone | 125 | 50 | 2 | 32 | N | X |\n| Siege Tank | 150 | 125 | 3 | 32 | S | ✔ |\n| Hellbat | 100 | 0 | 2 | 21 | R | X |\n| Thor | 300 | 200 | 6 | 43 | T | ✔ |\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you choose to go for a mechanical unit mix towards mid/endgame, then you'll need to build a few Factories to churn out the mechanical units. With the addition of the Widow Mine and the Hellbat, Mech-Play is a lot more viable. One opener for Mech that has been seen is a push with Marines and Widow Mines to deny the natural. Another successful harassment-method with Mech is Hellbat drops in TvZ and TvT. Hellbats can also replace Marines in TvT, but you will be giving up air control. They are, however, a much better meat shield.\n\nAlternatively, if you choose to go for a primarily Bio-based army the Factory can be used as a scout. The Starport is built as soon the Factory is finished and the Factory is Lifted from the ground and flown in the direction of the enemies base. Since the Starport tech has already started there is no downside to losing the Factory if you are not using its units for your composition. Also, the Factory has a large number of Hitpoints and 1 armor meaning it can withstand a large degree of punishment from enemy units while scouting. A side effect of using this Factory for scouting is that the Factory is landed inside the enemies base and Hellions can be produced and used for extras scouting or harassment. Again, due to the Factory's hitpoints, in the early stages of the game it can get Hellions onto the field even if the Factory is being attacked. Dustin Browder in an interview with Team Liquid, mentioned that this was not an intended usage of the Factory.[1]\n\nThe Factory is one of the key parts in the 1/1/1 build. Another successful build is a Factory opener with Hellion harass.\n\n## Abilities\n\nLift off\nDuration: 1 s\nLifts off a building, making it airborne and mobile.

{"document": "# Viking (Legacy of the Void)\n## Description\n\nThe Viking is an anti-air fighter with the ability to transform into an assault walker, with the transformation taking a number of seconds. The Viking is strongest when supported by units that can protect it from ground-based anti-air attacks. They are best suited for taking down strong, hard-hitting air units such as Void Rays, Corruptors, or Tempests (or Colossi) but do not fare as well against lighter and faster units such as the Mutalisk or Phoenix. Vikings are produced from a Starport (with or without a Reactor) and are generally produced in a set number as opposed to continuous production, in order to eliminate enemy air units cost-effectively.\n\nWith a range of 9 in fighter mode, Vikings greatly benefit from proper micromanagement: taking minimal fire from enemy air units while dealing damage, or forcing the enemy to retreat and relinquish air control. However the assault mode, withs its relatively lackluster damage, does not see much use in the current state of the game.\n\nA notable trick to use with large numbers of Vikings is to gather them all at once in a tight formation, which will make them stack onto each other. This will make focus-firing much easier and can sometimes confuse an opposing player by making it difficult to determine the Viking count. Being stacked like this will make the Vikings very vulnerable to area-of-effect and air splash damage, however. Although Blizzard attempted to remove this feature during patch 1.3, a slightly extended procedure achieves a similar result if not the same.[1]\n\nVikings in Assault Mode can be Loaded into Medivacs.", "question": "What is a notable trick to use with large numbers of Vikings in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Deploying them continuously without stopping", "Gathering them all at once in a tight formation", "Transforming them all into assault walkers simultaneously", "Upgrading their speed with an experimental patch"], "answer": "Gathering them all at once in a tight formation"}

{"document": "# 4 Warpgate Rush (Legacy of the Void)\n## Overview\n\nThe 4 Warpgate Rush, often referred to colloquially as the \"4 Gate\", is an aggressive opening most commonly used in PvP. Since Adept are strong in PvT, too, this build should work there as well. Due to the way that the Warpgate mechanic works, this build will allow you to produce a large burst of units in or around your opponent's base very early in the game, which will give you a good chance of killing the opponent if they weren't prepared for the rush. The build is an all-in as it is difficult to transition out of it without dealing very heavy damage to the economy of the opponent. The reason for this is that constant unit production from four Warpgates allows no resources for an expansion or additional tech.\n\nEven though it is strong again in LotV, most modern PvP openings don't actively take the 4 Gate into account. An early FE often struggles against this build. This means that a 4 Gate can still be used successfully against an unprepared opponent who fails to scout that it is coming as the 4 Gate rush is incredibly strong if it goes unscouted by an opponent who is trying to either tech-up or expand too quickly. Do note, however, that the 4 Gate is still a dominant PvP strategy on maps where Force Fields cannot be used to deflect or delay the rush or where Adepts can abuse their Psionic Transfer.\n\nThe 4 Gate relies heavily on the use of proxy Pylons to produce reinforcements as close to the opponent's base as possible. Keep in mind, you have to build at least one Gateway near the proxy Pylon. This is the key to the attack and if you are unable to place a proxy Pylon+Gate then it is highly likely that your rush will be deflected with ease.", "question": "In the 4 Warpgate Rush strategy, what is the key to ensuring the attack is successful and not easily deflected?", "options": ["Building an expansion early", "Using proxy Pylons to produce reinforcements close to the opponent's base", "Teching up to higher tier units quickly", "Focusing on defensive structures near your base"], "answer": "Using proxy Pylons to produce reinforcements close to the opponent's base"}
{"document": "# Campaign/Maw of the Void\n## Primary Objectives\n### Guide\n#### Cheap Strategy for Destroying the Mothership\n\nAssuming you've cleared out most of the Rip-Field generators, you can easily destroy the Mothership when it patrols into an open area (no Rip-Field) with cloaked Wraiths. This is probably one of the few missions where Wraiths are useful, so 10 Vikings and 8-10 Wraiths in addition to your main Battlecruiser (and Science Vessel) fleet is not a bad idea. Just leave your Wraiths and Viking groups behind your defending/resting Battlecruisers and Science Vessels, and move them forward to reinforce when needed. You can also send the Wraiths up ahead to intercept any Carriers and Void Rays the enemy send towards you and then just use their high mobility to pull back towards the Vikings and Battlecruisers if needed.\n\nWhen you are ready to deal with the Mothership, make sure you destroyed most of their Stargate production and there are no Observers around (on Hard there will be at least one, and on Brutal, it appears the enemy will continuously produce them if they are destroyed, but there won't be more than one present at a time). Send 8-10 Wraiths to attack the Mothership whiled cloaked and there is nothing it can do. Any units it mass recalls to it will also be destroyed by the cloaked Wraiths, making it ridiculously easy to deal with, without the hassle of micro-ing Vikings and Battlecruisers to avoid its Vortex or worry about it warping in reinforcements.", "question": "What is the key strategy for destroying the Mothership in the 'Maw of the Void' mission?", "options": ["Using a large number of Battlecruisers to attack directly", "Deploying cloaked Wraiths to attack when the Mothership is in an open area", "Sending in a group of Vikings to intercept the Mothership", "Constructing additional Stargates to overwhelm the Mothership with units"], "answer": "Deploying cloaked Wraiths to attack when the Mothership is in an open area"}

{"document": "# Static defense\n\nStatic Defense, sometimes shortened to static d, is any immobile object that provides defensive combat capabilities, most commonly referring to buildings. Dedicated buildings require no supply (except for the Bunker, which requires supply-consuming units inside). and have vital statistics more cost-effective than training army units. Walling is also a kind of static defense.\n\nBeing immobile, static defenses only operate in an certain area. Static defenses are often used to fortify a position which cannot be abandoned without serious consequences. An application of this could be defending from a rush or pressure play in the early game while attempting to tech up. Static Defenses can be overcome by bypassing them, such as with drops, or simply by attacking them with units that out-range them (available to all races at a certain tech progression).\n\nAnti-air defenses (Missile Turrets, Spore Crawlers, and Photon Cannons) are all Detectors.\n\nAlthough classified as \"Static Defense\", these buildings & units can also be used in a variety of offensive strategies.\n\n## Terran\n\n- Missile Turrets require an Engineering Bay and provide anti-air static defense and detection capabilities.\n\n- Bunkers require a Barracks. They do not provide combat capabilities on their own, but rather enhance the capabilities of Barracks units. Occupants may still attack, and their range is increased by 1. Bunkers may be Salvaged for 75% of their original cost.\n\n- Planetary Fortresses can be upgraded from the Command Center once an Engineering Bay has been made. They are the only static defense with an area of effect attack.\n\n- Siege Tanks, although able to move and shoot while unsieged, may be considered static defenses while in Siege Mode.\n\n- Similarly, the Liberator is immobile in its anti-ground Defender Mode.\n\n- The Auto-Turret and the (now-removed) Point Defense Drone, summoned from a Raven, serve as temporary static defenses.\n\n- Widow Mine\n\n## Protoss\n\n- Photon Cannons are the main static defense of the Protoss and require a Forge. They detect and can attack both ground and air units. Photon Cannons must be built within the Psionic Matrix and become inoperable if the matrix is removed for any reason.\n\n- Like the Bunker, the Shield Battery has no offensive capabilities of its own. It repairs the shields of nearby units at the cost of energy.\n\n- Photon Overcharge, a spell cast by the (now-removed) Mothership Core is another temporary source of static defense. In Heart of the Swarm, it had the same damage and weapon speed as a Photon Cannon, but with range 13 instead of 7. (Note: Nexus sight range is only 11.) In Legacy of the Void, it has the same range as a Photon Cannon, but a damage of 30 instead of 20.\n\n## Zerg\n\nBoth Zerg static defense buildings must be made on Creep and have the ability to uproot, move and re-root in a new location. They can only attack and detect while rooted.\n\n- Spine Crawlers require a Spawning Pool and provide anti-ground combat capabilities.\n\n- Spore Crawlers require a Spawning Pool and provide anti-air combat capabilities and detection.\n\n- The Lurker is a unit that must burrow to attack and is then immobile.", "question": "Which of the following static defenses can detect both ground and air units in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Missile Turrets", "Bunkers", "Photon Cannons", "Spine Crawlers"], "answer": "Photon Cannons"}

Make sure you leave a blocking Zealot at the top of your ramp (and also at your natural if you were able to create a choke). The first thing you want to do is to clear out scouting Zerglings and Overlords, thus darkening the Zerg's vision of the map. Taking control of Xel'Naga Towers with Zealots is a good option as Zerglings are very cost-inefficient against them, forcing Zerg to commit units to retake them.\n\nYou should mostly be warping in units at your base. Every time you warp-in another round of units, your army should return to your base, add those to your army, and then move out again. The overall effect of this army movement is to create an atmosphere of uncertainty for the Zerg; when you challenge them for map control, they need to build units instead of Drones in case they get attacked. This slows down their economy. This form of pressure is called “Shark Mode” because your army is like a shark: if you stop moving, you die. If you do not do this, the Zerg player will be free to Drone and crush you with his macro.\n\nDuring this time, you should also be trying to figure out which mid-game tech your opponent will focus on: Muta, Roach, or Baneling?

Mass Spine-Crawlers on only two bases can also be an indication that Mutalisks are being built.

From here, you can expand or tech to anything of your liking. One possibility is Blink Stalkers and about 4 Archons. The Archons are used to tank enemy fire (preferably Colossus fire), and do pretty darn well against Zealots due to splash damage. This goes great if the enemy went one or two base Colossus, since you can tank with the Archons and Blink into the Colossus to snipe them. This works well, as on two bases with Stalker production and 4 Assimilators as you'll have an excess in gas.\n\nAnother alternative would be to go with mass Warp Gates after you take a third base, and harass with multiple Warp Prisms, or just go in with one massive assault, Warp Prisming into the back of your opponent's base.\n\nDue to patches, Protoss air tech has become much more viable to use as an integral portion of your army.

{"document": "# Units (StarCraft)\n\n## Units\n\nUnits are produced from structures. These units constitute your army and perform essential roles such as base-building and attacking . Most units consume supply, which limits the number of units deployed at once.\n\nDifferent commands direct what units do (which also applies to buildings).\n\n### Abilities/Spells\n\nMany units have special abilities in addition to or instead of weapons. Units with multiple abilities that are used mostly for those abilities are called spellcasters.\n\nAbilities are special actions of a unit that differentiate it from other units. They may be manually activated, conditionally activated, auto-cast, passive, or permanently active effects. \"Autocast\" abilities can be toggled to activate automatically when certain conditions are met.\n\nSpells are manually-activated abilities that use up a certain amount of stored Energy. Spellcasters begin with 50 (although some units can be upgraded to start at 75) and generate up to 200. Generally speaking, spells in StarCraft II have extreme effects on units or the map and have no cooldown time, although they may have a cast time before they are activated, which sometimes leave the caster helpless. Some abilities and spells are present from the beginning of a game, and some must be unlocked with upgrades.\n\n### Workers\n\nWorkers are produced from the main base building for each race and cannot be made from any other building. They gather resources and construct buildings. In addition, Terran SCVs can use the repair ability. Workers have a weak melee attack that cannot be upgraded but can still help in critical early-game situations (or all-in rushes).\n\nWorkers are the  SCV, the  Probe and the  Drone. The  MULE is a special worker that can gather resources, but cannot build.\n\nSometimes workers are called Peons, it is a term inherited from WarCraft terminology.\n\n## Upgrades\n\nUpgrades improve the functionality of units by improving their basic statistics or granting them additional abilities. Most upgrades are retroactive, i.e. pre-existing units benefit. Upgrades that affect a unit's starting conditions (such as the Infestor's Pathogen Glands upgrade) do not affect extant units. Upgrades take time and resources to complete. They are researched at associated technology buildings. Most upgrades require Vespene Gas as well as Minerals.\n\n### Weapons/Armor\n\nWeapon / Armor Upgrades increase units' attack damage or armor. Attack upgrades apply to each packet, i.e., units with multiple attacks will especially benefit from attack upgrades. Conversely, armor is applied to each packet, so armor is doubly effective against these units. For example, a Zealot attacking a Zergling with level 1 armor will deal 2 less damage, because his Psi Blades deal their damage in a packet of two attacks. Some units gain more than one damage per weapons upgrade, but armor upgrades always have a value of one. The upgrade factor is given in parentheses after the basic damage, e.g. 15 (+3). \nEach race has a pair of upgrade buildings dedicated to these sets of upgrades. They are the  Engineering Bay and Armory, the  Evolution Chamber and Spire and the  Forge and Cybernetics Core.\n\nThese general guidelines do not necessarily apply to unit-specific upgrades; for example, the Ultralisk's Chitinous Plating upgrade adds two armor, rather than the usual one.\n\n### Abilities/Spells\n\nSome upgrades unlock additional Abilities or Spells on units, or increase the starting energy of spellcasters. Examples are  Blink,  Stimpack and  Pathogen Glands.\n\n### Other\n\nSome upgrades apply to individual buildings or units and change their functionality (referred to in-game as mutating, upgrading, morphing, or building units or buildings). They may require spending resources. Examples include the  Command Center to Orbital Command upgrade, \nCorruptor to Broodlord upgrade, and the  Overlord's Ventral Sacs upgrade. They should be distinguished from transformations like turning a  Gateway into a Warpgate, turning a  Hellion into a Hellbat, or the  Viking's different Modes.", "question": "Which of the following is a unique ability of Terran SCVs in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Repair", "Auto-Cast", "Blink", "Stimpack"], "answer": "Repair"}

Add-on's like a Reactor or Tech Lab can be built using different building and then swapped to acquire the desired production capabilities.\n\n## Viking Harassment\n\nIn a standard 111 build, 1Rax 1Fact 1Port, build a Viking as soon as possible.  If you have walled off well and built Marines and Hellions for base defense, you can use the Viking to scout the Zerg base.  Avoid Queens, and hunt for Overlords.  If you have 2-4 Vikings, dropping them behind the mineral line to take out drones can be damaging.\n\nThe objective of the early Viking harass is to distract the opponent, and possibly do some economic damage.  It can be paired with Hellion harassment, or combined with dropships to control the air and keep the opponent occupied with harassment.\n\n## Banshee Harassment\n\nThe build again requires a 111 build and a solid wall-off of your base.  It is gas-heavy, so building a second Refinery quickly is essential.  As soon as possible, build Banshees and tech cloak.  If the Zerg fast expands, harassing mineral lines at the FE and the main with separate Banshees can be difficult to counter.\n\nThe obvious counter is to get Overseers, and use Queens/Mutalisk/hydra to defend the drones.  If you have Vikings, it is possible to take out the Overseers and destroy their detection.\n\nAlthough this harassment can be powerful, Queens are very strong against Banshees.  Because this build is gas-heavy and takes a bit of time, if it fails, a counter-attack on your base can be devastating.  If the Zerg builds fast Mutalisk and has a few Overseers, the Banshees will fall quickly without doing much damage.\n\nThe key to this build is getting out two Banshees, as a single Banshee will be heavily damaged by one Queen, and quickly fall to two Queens, as it is becoming more popular for Zerg players to build extra Queens for spreading creep and casting infuse. Performed correctly, you should be able to build a pair of Banshees before significant AA has been produced. It is typical for your opponent to be in the process of building their Hydralisk Den or Spire when your Banshee(s) arrive. Sniping these buildings is critical if you want to maintain pressure with this build.\n\nNote:\nGoing for a double Starport directly after your Factory will increase the speed of getting your second Banshee. This is know at a 2 (or double) port Banshee build and is effective because a Banshee is able to kill a Queen one-on-one. Thus if the Zerg player only has two Queens the Banshees are free to do a lot of damage.\n\n## Maps\n\nThe 111 build is most effective on maps with long rush distances but short air positions. Maps like Scrap Station allow for very fast drops or Banshees. If the spawn positions are further apart, such as on a map like Xel'Naga Caverns, then the Starport can be placed in a \"proxy\" location to shorten the distance the units must travel. The faster the Banshee(s) or Viking(s) reach the Zerg base, the more effective they will be.", "question": "What is the primary objective of early Viking harassment in a StarCraft II Terran vs. Zerg match?", "options": ["To scout the opponent's base and cause economic damage through drone attacks", "To build a large army of Vikings for a direct attack", "To distract the opponent while constructing a third base", "To take out the Zerg's Overlords and prevent scouting"], "answer": "To scout the opponent's base and cause economic damage through drone attacks"}

When it hatches, an Infested Terran emerges with health proportional to the percentage health of the egg, i.e. an egg that's at 50% health hatches an Infested Terran with only 50% health. The Infested Terran lasts for 21 seconds; it can attack up to 34 times during its duration, resulting in a maximum of 204 damage dealt (without armor or upgrades being taken into account).\n\n## Use\n\nInfested Terrans are generally used in conjunction with Fungal Growth to pick off enemy drops, or deal extra damage to an army as an energy dump. Infested Terrans can be used as a form of worker harassment. As of Patch 16, Infested Terrans can be cast while the Infestor is burrowed and therefore hidden. Infestors in groups of 6 or more can tunnel into an enemy base and spawn multiple Infested Terrans to snipe key buildings like Robotics Bays or Command Centers.\n\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nProtoss units are fairly resistant to Infested Terran; however, they can be used to add anti-air damage for a Zerg player who opted not to go for Hydralisks. They are especially effective against Interceptors as well as Phoenixes.\n\n### Vs. Terran\n\nVersus biomech builds, Infestors can cast Infested Terran on top of an infantry ball, and sieged Siege Tanks will splash their own units. Infested Terrans are also very useful to shoot down incoming or retreating Medivac dropships, commonly with the help of Fungal Growth to keep them in place.\n\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nInfested Terrans can be used around a ranged Zerg army to block Ultralisks. The eggs work especially well because of their low aggro, high HP, and good spread to avoid splash. They can also be used to deal with Mutalisks by using Fungal Growth to pin them, allowing the Infested Terrans time to hatch and kill them.\n\n## Other\n\n- Unlike other summoned Zerg units, such as the Broodling or Changeling, the Infested Terrans have the ability to burrow. However, given their limited lifespan, it is almost never used.\n\n- Similarly to other summoned units, Infested Terrans cannot be loaded into an Overlord, Nydus Network or Nydus Worm.\n\n- When time span of an Infested Terran runs out, the Infested Terran commits suicide with a handgun [1]\n\n- The Infested Swarm Egg has no attributes, not even Biological. It is the only unit besides the Archon that is neither Biological nor Mechanical.\n\n- Infested Swarm Eggs have no sight, unlike cocooned units, which have a sight of 5.\n\n## External links\n\n- Infested Terran's portrait - YouTube video.", "question": "What is the primary use of Infested Terrans in conjunction with Fungal Growth in StarCraft II?", "options": ["To provide healing to Zerg units", "To pick off enemy drops and deal extra damage to an army", "To create additional Infested Swarm Eggs", "To increase the speed of Zerg ground units"], "answer": "To pick off enemy drops and deal extra damage to an army"}
{"document": "# 4\n## Reacting to the Zerg\n### Hive Rush\n\nTo better understand this strategy we will take a close look at a game of YoDa's. YoDa vs RorO from WCS Korea Season 1 Code S Ro16 2013 to be exact. RorO skipped Infestors and went straight to hive tech and Ultras. His Hive started at 11:45. He used mass Speedling and a few Banes to hold the 11:30 timing from YoDa, and more importantly, counterattacked constantly as his Hive built to keep Yoda on the back foot. YoDa denies the fourth of RorO over and over but never hurts the three base economy before Ultras are already on the way. As soon as he spots the Ultralisk Cavern, he attempts to do mass drops, but by then it is too late and RorO begins to get a return on his risky investment into extremely fast Ultras.\n\nYoDa needed to identify the strategy of RorO by around 12 minutes at the latest and do doom drops and/or multi-pronged drops. Denying the fourth over and over is not enough to hold back the surge of army power that the Zerg will get by around the 18-19 minute mark. The conclusion here would be if you see a Zerg on mass upgraded Speedlings with an extreme absence of gas units to Scan for a hive or use a Medivac to scout for his Hive. Just after 12 minutes YoDa spots a huge army of Zerglings and has seen RorO attempt to take a fourth over and over. His conclusion should be that RorO is saving gas and not trying to win on three bases. The only time that mass dropping will not work very well is if they have added a lot of static defense. In the case of that, simply deny his fourth base as much as possible, and add on your extra Barracks with Tech Labs as soon as possible (you want four total tech lab'd Barracks).\n\nIn general vs this style, it is ok to fight small battles but avoid big fights in the mid game. Once you have 3/3 and a good mixture of Marauders in your army, you can be more aggressive and push in a more direct way.", "question": "When facing a Zerg player who is rushing to Hive tech with mass Speedlings and few gas units, what is the most effective counter-strategy according to the document?", "options": ["Focusing on denying the fourth base repeatedly without taking other actions.", "Building more static defense to counter the Zergling attacks.", "Initiating mass drops and multi-pronged drops to disrupt the Zerg economy and army.", "Waiting until the Ultralisk Cavern is built before taking any action."], "answer": "Initiating mass drops and multi-pronged drops to disrupt the Zerg economy and army."}

{"document": "# +1 4 Gate Stargate Third (vs. Zerg)\n## Build Order\n### Variant A - Fast Third\n\nIf you see your opponent is going for a fast third base then you instantly know several key things. Firstly, the opponent's gas (required for Metabolic Boost, Roaches and Lair) will be delayed. Secondly, they will be droning as hard as they can in order to take full advantage of their quick third base. This means that, due to the delayed Roach timing, your 4 gate +1 Zealot push will be able to hit before the opponent has enough Roaches and Speedlings to properly defend, giving you a strong timing window in which to deal damage.\n\nThe plan is to first clear out your third base (he will not have burrow yet) of any enemy Zerglings with a Zealot whilst sending the rest of your Zealots to attack the opponent's third base. Place down a Nexus at your third base, and fortify it with cannons if necessary. Help wall off your third base with extra Gateways. While doing this, place a proxy Pylon as close to their third base as you safely can. Warp-in your first round of 4 Zealots and then take the Assimilators at your natural expansion. Place down a Twilight Council. As soon as it finishes, send your first Void Ray to join in the attack. Once the attack ends use it to hunt Overlords around the map.\n\nIf they continue to make pure Zergling then continue warping-in Zealots. If they start Roach production then warp-in Stalkers. Once you feel you have enough units to snipe the Hatchery, focus fire the Hatchery and then head home. If they have enough units to safely defend head home without attacking.\n\nHere is a step-by-step build order for executing this timing-attack after opening with a standard YufFE:\n\n| \"+1 4 Gate Stargate vs. Fast Third\" |\n| --- |\n| @100% Cybernetics Core: Warpgate Research[1]; @100 Gas: +1 Weapons Upgrade[2]; @150 Gas: Stargate; @100% Stargate: Void Ray[3]; @100% Warpgate Research: Convert All 4 Gateways; Attack!; Take Your Third Nexus; Take Natural Gasses; Twilight Council |\n| ↑ Note: Build 4 Additional Gateways So That They Finish In Time With The Warpgate Upgrade.; ; ↑ Note: Chronoboost +1 Weapons and Warpgate Research So That Both Finish ~7:10; ; ↑ Note: Use The Void Ray To Kill Any Overlords Near Your Base Before Sending It To Join The Attack. |\n\n- @100% Cybernetics Core: Warpgate Research[1]\n\n- @100 Gas: +1 Weapons Upgrade[2]\n\n- @150 Gas: Stargate\n\n- @100% Stargate: Void Ray[3]\n\n- @100% Warpgate Research: Convert All 4 Gateways\n\n- Attack!\n\n- Take Your Third Nexus\n\n- Take Natural Gasses\n\n- Twilight Council\n\n- ↑ Note: Build 4 Additional Gateways So That They Finish In Time With The Warpgate Upgrade.\n\n- ↑ Note: Chronoboost +1 Weapons and Warpgate Research So That Both Finish ~7:10\n\n- ↑ Note: Use The Void Ray To Kill Any Overlords Near Your Base Before Sending It To Join The Attack.\n\nIf the attack does manage to kill off the third base the Protoss player will be far in the lead. A careful defence of a likely all-in is required. In general, 7 to 9 Gateways with Blink and +2 Ground Weapons will be enough to handle more basic/low-Tech allins with good micro. After these have been started, a Robotics Bay followed by a Colossus Den is advised to avoid losing to a 2 base build-up of Roach or Roach Hydralisk and to detect Tunneling Claw Roaches.\n\nIf the attack does not manage to kill off the third base the game is up in the air depending on how much Larva was wasted and which units were killed. In general, a cannon defence coupled with Blink Stalker and +2 Zealots will be enough to stall for Colossi, at which point Protoss can continue to push and head into the late game on strong economy and Tech.", "question": "What is the primary reason for a Protoss player to execute a +1 4 Gate Stargate Third attack against a Zerg player with a fast third base?", "options": ["To exploit the delayed Roach timing and Metabolic Boost, allowing for a strong early-game push", "To disrupt the Zerg player's Overlord scouting capabilities", "To force the Zerg player into an all-in attack", "To test the Zerg player's micro skills"], "answer": "To exploit the delayed Roach timing and Metabolic Boost, allowing for a strong early-game push"}
{"document": "# Zealot (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Terran\n\nZealots are a crucial unit against Terran. They are still capable units, but their importance is mainly because their health efficiency lets them effectively support more expensive damage-dealing units such as the Immortal. However, they get a lot better from upgrades. With Charge they become a more threatening unit in their own right and get the capability for worker harassment, while with 100 health they benefit a lot from armor upgrades at the Forge.\n\nThe Zealot is effective against bio (ie the Marine and Marauder units). One of the tensions in this matchup is between the players' upgrades. Stimpack and Concussive Shells make it easier for the Terran to kite. However, by upgrading Charge, Zealots can close the distance to the ranged-only Terran units much more quickly, minimizing the damage they take before engaging them and forcing the Terran player to position much more carefully. Because Charge is such a major speed increase, the Zealots can also be used to simply outrun the enemy and deny them from retreating. They can simply surround the entire Terran army, rendering it immobile and very susceptible to High Templar or Colossus attacks. However, Charge no longer adds extra damage, making it a slightly lower priority compared to damage-increasing options than it was in past patches.\n\nLate game transitions into gas-heavy units such as Colossi and High Templar rely heavily on large numbers of Zealots to buy time for the more expensive units to deal large amounts of splash damage. At this stage their cheapness and mobility with Charge also makes them great for harassing expansions. Other units that work well with Zealots are the Warp Prism, dropping and/or warping in Zealots to serve a very good counterattack option, harassing and deterring Terran pushes; while the Sentry's Guardian Shield can be effective at further increasing the unit's durability (although the cheaper armor upgrades should come first).", "question": "Which upgrade enhances the Zealot's ability to close the distance to Terran ranged units quickly, thereby minimizing the damage Zealots take before engaging?", "options": ["Plasma Shields", "Concussive Shells", "Charge", "Stimpack"], "answer": "Charge"}

Indeed, the most prevalent opening nowadays is to do a 1 Rax FE into an Hellion pressure, followed with Banshees. This opening is very strong, since it allows the Terran to be safe against a Zergling/Baneling attack (thanks to Hellions) and to a Roach Bust (thanks to Banshees that can see the push coming and soften the Roaches on their way to the base).\n\nHowever, with the help of a Nydus Network, it is possible to circumvent the Banshees and Hellions and deal a crippling blow to an unprepared opponent.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| \"Curious' 2 Base Nydus\" |\n| --- |\n| 9 - Overlord; 15 - Hatchery; 16 - Extractor; 16 - Spawning Pool; @100% Spawning Pool - Two Queens + Four Zerglings; @100gas - Metabolic Boost + Pull all Drones off gas.; @4:15 - Put one Drone back to gas; @100%Queen - One more Queen; @5:30 - Put two Drone back to gas (Total of three); @5:45 - Extractor (2); @100gas - Lair (Around 42 Supply); @6:30 - Extractor (3) + Spine Crawler; @7:00 - Roach Warren + Nydus Network (Lair should have just finished); @40 Drones - Start Roaches production + one Queen.; @100% Nydus Network - Nydus Worm outside your opponent's natural. |\n|  |\n\n- 9 - Overlord\n\n- 15 - Hatchery\n\n- 16 - Extractor\n\n- 16 - Spawning Pool\n\n- @100% Spawning Pool - Two Queens + Four Zerglings\n\n- @100gas - Metabolic Boost + Pull all Drones off gas.\n\n- @4:15 - Put one Drone back to gas\n\n- @100%Queen - One more Queen\n\n- @5:30 - Put two Drone back to gas (Total of three)\n\n- @5:45 - Extractor (2)\n\n- @100gas - Lair (Around 42 Supply)\n\n- @6:30 - Extractor (3) + Spine Crawler\n\n- @7:00 - Roach Warren + Nydus Network (Lair should have just finished)\n\n- @40 Drones - Start Roaches production + one Queen.\n\n- @100% Nydus Network - Nydus Worm outside your opponent's natural.\n\n### Notes\n\n- You will only have 40 Drones for this attack, so you want to make sure your saturation is optimal on your two bases.\n\n- Adding an Evolution Chamber for safety is optional, but recommended if you think your opponent may be going for Cloak.\n\n### Scouting\n\n- Before executing this build, you need to confirm that you are indeed facing a 1 Rax FE into 1/1/1 Tech. In order to do so, you want to poke as often as possible with your four Zerglings at your opponent's natural, and scout for the edge of the base with an Overlord to confirm the Starport.\n\n## Execution\n\n- If your opponent's natural is undefended, you may want to bust the ramp to the main immediately to end the game.\n\n- If you see that your opponent does not have vision on a part of his or her base, you should consider putting the Nydus in the main rather than outside the natural.\n\n- Do not Forget to bring an Overseer with you if your opponent opened with Cloak Banshees.\n\n## Adaptation\n\n- If your opponent is going for an important number of Barracks, you should abandon this build as you will probably not be able to bust the front with pure Roaches: a Roach/Baneling transition may be a good option to consider.\n\n- If your opponent is lifting the natural and is able to save a large number of SCVs, you should put a soft contain with the Roaches you have, and macro while playing safe (spores and spines at your expands).\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\n- Larger maps where your opponent is more likely to feel confident and open for a Tech build\n\n- Large main base where you could hide a Nydus\n\n### Con features\n\n- Tight choke at the Natural that can be easily defended with a small number of units\n\n- Close spawn situation, where your opponent may not opt for a greedy opening.", "question": "What is the primary purpose of using a Nydus Network in Curious' 2 Base Nydus build against Terran?", "options": ["To build a hidden base inside the Terran's territory", "To exploit a timing attack when the Terran army is weak and bypass Banshees and Hellions", "To provide a safe path for Zerglings to attack the Terran's main base", "To distract the Terran player while Zerglings attack the natural expansion"], "answer": "To exploit a timing attack when the Terran army is weak and bypass Banshees and Hellions"}

Try not to lose any Overlords as it is very problematic to be supply blocked.\n\n## Execution\n\nAt around 50 supply, you should have ~13 Roaches. Send the Roaches out to your opponents natural with the mass of Zerglings, and keep producing lings throughout the battle. All your lings should be rallied to your opponents base, where they should immediately engage. Try to micro so that your Roaches arrive first and then the lings stream in to surround your opponents Roaches/lings/Spine Crawlers. If your opponent has gone fast Mutalisks, opt for a base trade and keep streaming lings in.

{"document": "# Mental Checklist\n## Difference between MCL and APM spam\n\nTo spam APM is a very common among players in higher leagues. It is causing quite a few problems in lower leagues, though.\n\nThink about this statement. If the player who clicks the fastes always wins, you could teach SC2 to a 9-year-old kid. Has the world ever seen a 9-year-old WCS champion, of course not. SC2 is an incredibly complex game.\n\nBecause APM spam focuses on quickness and not accuracy it is counter-intuitive when you learn SC2. One example: Spammers often forget about Worker Stack. Note: Worker Stack was more important in WoL and HotS - 6 workers at the start - than it is in LotV.\n\nStacking workers is not important until you are in Masters. But getting an extra boost in your economy is of course more important than APM spam. Some pros even do it on two bases. Worker Stack will help you to hit Timings and Benchmarks.\n\nA good 4 Warpgate Rush would hit at 5:47, if all timings went well. 5:32 Warpgate Research is be ready, at 5:42 all Gates are transformed to Warpgates (10 seconds) and 5 seconds to warp in units. Some players cut corners and they do not build any units at all until Warpgate Research is done. It is important to protect your Proxy-Pylon with 1 Zealot and 2 Stalkers. Your Proxy-Pylon should be build at 5:10. In one of the videos below, the Proxy-Pylon is build after the 7-minute-mark[6].\n\nIf you train your Timings and Benchmarks and playing accurately, you will execute the 4Gate better and faster. It is important to focus on accuracy, not APM(spam). A high APM will come over time. It will automatically rise with your MCL-Training.\n\nLogic dictates, that a 4 Warpgate Rush at 6:05[7] is better than at 7:00[6]. If spamming (APM) prevent hitting those Chrono Boosts or your other timings and benchmarks, you should simply stop spamming.\n\nA high APM after a game at your Score Screen is worthless, if you fail your Build Order. The MCL focuses on perfect execution, on timing things well to establish a small lead, if your opponent is as good as you are.\n\nThe difference between MCL and APM spam is real skill. To press 4, 5 and 6 without meaning is not difficult it all, the MCL is; to check your production, watch the minimap and your money and execute a perfect build is extremely hard.", "question": "What is the importance of stacking workers in StarCraft II according to the document?", "options": ["It is crucial for all levels of play.", "It is only important in the Masters league.", "It is less important than APM spam.", "It is not important at all."], "answer": "It is only important in the Masters league."}

{"document": "# Widow Mine (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Terran\n\nWidow mines are a somewhat seldom seen unit in TvT. Since Raven openings are so common, and all Terran combat units are ranged, they will find little success against traditional Marine/Siege Tank armies. Due to Tanks being such an important factor in ground engagements, and factory production being so paramount as a result, Mines are made rarely in the matchup.\n\nAlthough not typically used in the main army composition, there are a few ways that Widow Mines still do see some use.Hellions are a more common choice for the volatile early game, but Widow Mines can be an option to punish Hellion/Reaper pokes and posture for the drop.They can one-shot Hellions or Cyclones, deal considerably high AoE damage to Reapers or Marines and serves as a scout which will not respond to F2 A-moving commands. Detection is scant in the very beginning of the game, so there is a window where a single Widow Mine can kill something valuable from your careless opponent.\n\nAnother scenario which may see Widow Mine usage is for a Mech player, as a Hellion/Hellbat alternative from Reactored Factories. Though weak in frontal engagements, they can help secure a defensive position, especially vs a Bio player sending heavy harass or another Mech player sending out sizable groups of Hellions. Placing Mines throughout the map can offer map vision as well as harry reinforcement routes, which may go unnoticed by an inattentive player.

You aim to get 1 Barracks with Reactor and then expand at about 7-8 minutes into the game. Always remember that a player with a mobile army can always counterattack.\n\n### Goal\n\nThis build is not very micro intensive. Macro wise you must always make Marines and SCV's, but if your opponent is going for an aggressive bio build as well or with this same build, you may wish to delay your Reactor and make 2 more Marines instead.\n\n## Basic Build Order\n\n| Basic Build |\n| --- |\n| Timings mostly relative; ; 10 Supply Depot; 12 Barracks (Marines throughout); 13 Refinery (1); 15 Orbital Command; 17 Reactor on Barracks; 18 Command Center (2); Supply Depot (and throughout); 20 Barracks (2); 23 Barracks (3); 24 Supply depot; 27 Tech Lab on Barracks; Expand to natural |\n\nTimings mostly relative\n\n- 10 Supply Depot\n\n- 12 Barracks (Marines throughout)\n\n- 13 Refinery (1)\n\n- 15 Orbital Command\n\n- 17 Reactor on Barracks\n\n- 18 Command Center (2)\n\n- Supply Depot (and throughout)\n\n- 20 Barracks (2)\n\n- 23 Barracks (3)\n\n- 24 Supply depot\n\n- 27 Tech Lab on Barracks\nExpand to natural\n\n- Expand to natural\n\n### Notes\n\n- Put all your Marines on your ramp separated by 1 matrix, to stop a 5 Marine/Hellion push.\n\n- If you get pushed (as shown in the aforementioned Day[9] daily) with 5 Marines 1 tank and a Medivac, you should have about 12 Marines by the time it arrives (if you have been keeping up with your macro, not getting supply-blocked, always making units, etc.,) and should be able to deal with the push.\n\n- You will get 2 more Barracks after your expansion, addons are not necessary.\n\n- After your first small push try to take a 3rd, not necessarily a High Yield expansion, but a relatively close and easily accessible 3rd base.\n\n### Scouting\n\nThis build should do fine versus the 1/1/1 build, Tank/Viking, and Tank/Thor play, while on the other hand being safe versus any one base aggression. The one thing that you need to be afraid of is the Ravens PDD. Scout first and foremost for a Starport and if possible for an Armory. If you see a Reactor on the Starport and Tech Lab on Factory expect the usual Tank/Viking, if you see Armory and no addon on Starport it's clearly Thor/Tank. Mass Barracks prepare for a drop!\n\n## Execution\n\nYou should be always spending your Command Center's energy on M.U.L.E.'s, but it does not hurt to scan your opponent's base in mid-game, since you have the early economic advantage. This build, and Terran in general, highly relies on unit counters and strategy. \nFor the main attack, group your Marines up, moving them to the opponent's base, with a Medivac scouting ahead/sideways. Set up position to do as much damage as you can while expanding to your third while constantly rallying Marines to your forces.\n\n### Adaptation\n\nFrom this build you can transition fairly easily into Marine/Marauder drop and in the late game. If your opponent does not have a Tank/Viking army, make 1 or 2 Battlecruisers to support your ground forces. If he already has mass Vikings before you have any Cruisers, do not bother making them. Add an Armory for Thors and more Factories/Starports as is fit.\n\n## Maps\n\n### Pro features\n\nWorks well on maps with a large path to the opponent.\n\n### Con features\n\nMaps that encourage fast Hellion or short air distance Scrap Station\n\n## Counter to\n\n- 2 port Banshee (depends on rush distance)\n\n- 1 port Banshee\n\n- qxc Ghost first\n\n## Countered by\n\n- Fast Tank push\n\n- Fast drop with Thors/Tanks\n\n- Bad army position against Tanks\n\n## Notes\n\nThe name of this build is long but it should be understandable, probably in the future it will be the stc build, or just 1 rax expand stc style. etc.\n\n## External links\n\nDay[9] analyzes this build\n\nHDStarcraft shows this build when StC plays against StarWars", "question": "In the STC FE into 3 Rax (vs. Terran) build, what should you always be spending your Command Center's energy on?", "options": ["Supply Depots", "M.U.L.E.'s", "Marines", "Scouts"], "answer": "M.U.L.E.'s"}

{"document": "# Contain\n\n Contain\"A Protoss contain using Sentries and Stalkers\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Opening\n\n## Definition\n\nContaining is a tactic that involves placing units or buildings in positions that makes it difficult for opposing units to leave an area. The opposing forces are required to initiate battle under unfavorable conditions (usually from within a main or natural base). A contain can range from simply setting up a concave at a choke point to constructing static defenses, thereby creating an entrenched position with artificial choke points.\n\n## Strategic Advantage\n\nThe main purpose of a contain is to gain map control. Once achieved, the player executing the contain is free to expand without fear of being attacked at their base. Since the opponent is effectively trapped inside their own base, the opponent's expansion will be very delayed, thus giving the containing player a large economic edge.\n\n## Breaking a Contain\n\nUsing brute force to break a contain, while possible, is usually not advisable. The way in which a contain is set up will almost always create favorable battle conditions (such as Choke Points and Unit Positioning) for the containing player in a straight-up engagement. If possible, it is best to use alternate means to leave your base, thus circumventing the contain. Possible escape methods include:\n\n- Medivac\n\n- Nydus Worm\n\n- Ventral Sacs\n\n- Warp Prism\n\n- Mass Recall\n\n- Warping from Pylon or Warp Prism\n\nAfter successfully leaving your base, you can either use your position to flank the containing units, or move in for a counterattack on the enemy base. A counterattack forces the enemy to abandon their entrenched position, allowing you to retake map control and expand. If the enemy does not scout you leaving your own base and counterattacking theirs, it is likely that your attack will result in a base trade situation.\n\n## Common Contains by Race\n\nTechnically, a contain can be achieved with any unit. However, these are some of the more commonly  used contain methods.\n\n### Protoss\n\n- Photon Cannon Contain\n\n- Sentry Contain (Force Fields on enemy's ramp)\n\n### Terran\n\n- Bunker Contain\n\n- Siege Tank Contain\n\n(Note: Terran may wish to add Engineering bays or supply depot walls to their contains to further restrict enemy movement. Terran contains also commonly include Missile Turrets for detection and anti-air)\n\n### Zerg\n\n- Spine Crawler Contain (via either Proxy Hatch or Generate Creep/Creep Tumor)", "question": "Which of the following is NOT a common method for breaking a contain in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Medivac", "Nydus Worm", "Ventral Sacs", "Siege Tank"], "answer": "Siege Tank"}
{"document": "# Swarm Host (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nSwarm Hosts can be very powerful against Protoss. Typically Nydus Worms are paired with the Swarm Hosts to give them added mobility while the Zerg player plays defensively at first. They can also be played with a more Map Presence focused style, complemented by Roach/Ravager groups looking for positional plays.\n\nThe first target of a Swarm Host player will usually be a Nexus, often in the opponent's Main Base. If caught off guard by the attack, the Protoss may go for an all-in attack while the Locusts are on cool down and the cost of the investment (especially supply wise) into the Swarm Hosts cannot help on defense. If a Locust wave is forced to be used defensively, the Protoss will likely back off until the Swarm Hosts are on cool-down again and continue applying pressure in an effort to stop the damage at home. It is unusual for a Protoss to sit back and not try to get counter damage, even if they have not taken major damage right away, as the Locust waves cost nothing but any potential Nydus Worms and will not stop until the Swarm Hosts are killed or rendered ineffective.\n\nThis strategy is especially effective against an opponent who has opened up without a Stargate. Almost all defenses against Nydus/Swarm Host play will require the mobility of flying units to push away spotters/deny Nydus Worms and minimize the damage from the endless waves of locusts. Oracles offer a very strong tool against the Locusts' short life in the form of Stasis Wards; once caught, every locust will expire before the trap wears off. Micro against this is very important, since any locust wave that does not do major damage to the Protoss economy, production, or army (especially more technical units) leaves the Zerg player vulnerable to a counter-attack. Sending in a few Locusts in advance to trigger any potential stasis wards can aide in reducing the threat, but may be killed by the defending Protoss army before they can Swoop. Overseers may prove invaluable since their Changeling ability can trigger stasis traps for only the cost of energy if dropped on top of active traps (which they would be able to see), or else simply verify the existence and position of any traps guarding a base. The Pulsar Beam of a single Oracle is also enough to kill a Nydus worm if caught early enough. If the Swarm Host player opts against using Nydus Worms, Revelations can be used to keep tabs on the Swarm Host group.\n\nAside from the benefits from Oracles, the Roach melting ability of Void Rays, and the raw power of Carriers, the Stargate allows for perhaps the most useful tool against Locust waves: the Mothership. Without sacrificing many Overseers, the Locusts will have no recourse against a fully cloaked base (unless the Mothership is by itself, covering a base while the army protects another). The Mothership may be rushed to before any other Fleet Beacon tech in order to gain this defensive tool. By this point, the Protoss player should be able to whether most Locust waves without too much trouble, and Swarm Host play will slowly taper off as the Zerg gets less and less from their supply in the Zerg army.", "question": "Which unit can effectively use Stasis Wards to counter the Locusts produced by Swarm Hosts in StarCraft II?", "options": ["Zealot", "Oracle", "High Templar", "Colossus"], "answer": "Oracle"}

{"document": "# Tempest (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n### Vs. Protoss\n\nTempests have somewhat returned as a viable option after the 4.7.1 patch which reduced their cost. Prior to this, Tempests were rarely seen in Protoss Vs Protoss games as they offered limited benefit compared to other Protoss options and were far too expensive to be efficient. Even currently, their relatively low damage output makes them a sub-par option against most Protoss builds. Carriers can out-DPS Tempests, but the Carriers are also marginally slower and more expensive; it is a question of micro.\n\nVoid Rays are extremely strong against Tempest, due to their bonus damage against armored units. Tempests can be used with late game army to snipe enemy Colossi and forcing the enemy to retreat or to fight an unfavorable engagement.

{"document": "# Campaign\n## Wings of Liberty\n### Overview\n\nThe Wings of Liberty Campaign follows the exploits of the Terran outlaws Jim Raynor and Tychus Findlay. Specifically, the player is assumed to have the role of Raynor from a third-person perspective. The first three missions must be completed in order, after which a series of events occurs that enables the player to begin directing the order in which missions are played.\n\nNew units are acquired during each mission, which may then be used in any future missions (except the Prophecy missions, in which the player does not use Terran units). In some cases, the capability to produce a particular type of unit can dramatically alter the challenge of a given mission. Many of the missions force the player to take a defensive position (in contrast to multiplayer), which makes Siege Tanks a particularly beneficial unit to unlock as early as possible.\n\nEach mission can be completed using Casual, Normal, Hard, or Brutal difficulty. New players who have never played any video games in their entire life or are just new to RTS (Real time strategy) type games should probably begin on Normal - the Casual difficulty is very, very casual, to the point that enemies only very rarely attack and usually sit about waiting for the player to come and slaughter them - and their units have only half of their normal HP. In most cases, playing on Hard or Brutal adds more depth to a mission. For example, in the Zero Hour mission on Normal difficulty, the player has to deal with only the assaults of the Zerg, whereas in Hard and Brutal, there are Zerg \"drop pods\" that crash into the ground delivering Creep Tumors and Zerglings. These drop pods gradually begin to descend closer and closer to the player's base, and since Zerg units move more rapidly on Creep, this can ramp up the challenge quickly.\n\nMost missions reward the player with Credits, as well as the potential to acquire Research points by completing side objectives (see below for more details on both). All missions also feature achievement challenges. In most cases, there is one challenge for completing all of the side objectives, which can be obtained on any difficulty, one challenge that can only be finished on at least Normal difficulty, and one challenge that can only be finished on at least Hard difficulty. Playing every mission on at least Hard difficulty is generally an easy way to enable a savvy player to complete all achievements on a single play of the mission.", "question": "Which unit is particularly beneficial to unlock as early as possible due to the defensive nature of many missions in the Wings of Liberty Campaign?", "options": ["Marine", "Ghost", "Siege Tank", "Medic"], "answer": "Siege Tank"}
{"document": "# 2 Gate Zealot Rush\n## Execution\n\n- Your Probe should get to the proxy location in time to build a Pylon as soon as 100 minerals have been accumulated. Because the rush distance is different for different maps, you may wish to test the timing at which you need to send a Probe for any map you're planning to use this strategy on.\n\n- You should choose a proxy location that is not along the common scouting path your opponent is likely to take. Against a Zerg opponent, try to avoid common Overlord scouting paths.\n\n- You may also try to proxy your buildings inside your opponent's base. This is only viable on maps that are large enough for you to hide two Gateways without them being visible from common building placement locations.\n\n- In general, it is best to send your first Zealot in immediately. While 1 Zealot cannot take on all their workers, you will delay your opponent's mining substantially and stop your opponent from getting their defensive units out as easily as they otherwise would.\n\n- Against a Protoss opponent, if the opponent has only one Pylon powering their initial Gateway then you might wish to target it. Successfully removing power from the opponent's initial Gateway in this manner should win you the game. Do not sacrifice your initial Zealot to merely damage the Pylon if they pull all their probes. Instead, stutter-step your Zealot against Probes and stall for your two backup Zealots, which will be able to take on his ~12 Probe 1 Zealot army. If possible, never let a Zealot die, and instead allow its shields to recharge; keeping your timing window in mind, you can and should attempt to not lose a single Zealot during the entire rush.\n\n- If you cannot outright destroy their army, your focus should be to cut their worker count and stall your opponent's mining while waiting for your Gateways to produce more units. Your window for successfully whittling down his Probe count is between your attack and their ranged defensive units/buildings being produced in large enough number to deflect your Zealots (e.g. Stalkers, Mothership Core, Queens, Cannons, Spine Crawlers etc.).\n\n- In a BoX situation vs. a Zerg player, this rush can be useful in the second game of the series having shown a Gateway-based opening in the first game of the series. This is as the Zerg player may respond to you not going for a FFE by opening Hatchery First, which this all-in can work well against.", "question": "In a 2 Gate Zealot Rush strategy, what is the best course of action if you cannot outright destroy your opponent's army?", "options": ["Retreat immediately and focus on defending your base", "Build more Gateways and ignore your opponent's workers", "Cut their worker count and stall their mining while waiting for reinforcements", "Switch to a macro game and focus on teching up"], "answer": "Cut their worker count and stall their mining while waiting for reinforcements"}

This option is intended to help keep them undetected.\n\n- When a unit or building is attacking a target with the highest priority while carrying out an explicit \"attack target\" command, issuing a \"stop\" command will not cause the attacking to stop nor the target to switch. One particular use case for this behavior can be found in cannon rushing: a certain enemy building can be prioritized while still immediately responding to nearing units.[1]\n\n- The \"Always a Threat to Attackers\" flag was likely introduced to alleviate the frustration of juicy targets such as spellcasters and units with special attacks only being targeted very late in fights. However, in some situations the effects of the flag can be unintuitive. For example, air-to-ground units may prioritize closer ground-to-ground units (Disruptors, Lurkers, Swarm Hosts) over potentially more dangerous ground-to-air units and buildings (Hydralisks, Spore Crawlers, Stalkers, Photon Cannons).\n\n- AI players treat workers (including MULEs) as if they had an ATP value of 10, which gives them a lower priority than buildings. This feature is called \"Override Target Priority\" and is likely meant as a favor to human opponents.", "question": "When an SCV is repairing a Missile Turret, how does it affect the SCV's priority in the eyes of a Mutalisk?", "options": ["The SCV becomes a higher priority target than the Turret.", "The SCV becomes a lower priority target than the Turret.", "The SCV's priority remains unchanged.", "The SCV is no longer considered a target."], "answer": "The SCV becomes a higher priority target than the Turret."}

{"document": "# Walling\n## Competitive Use\n### Protoss (2 Base)\n\nAlternatively, on certain maps, some players tend to build their initial Pylon and later their Gateway(s) at the choke of their Natural so that they can wall it off later, making their expansion easier to defend.\n\nIn HotS and LotV openings like Gate-Core-Expand or 2Gate-Adept-Harass have become more popular than FFE.

A large Choke like the one on Ruins of Seras requires training. Walling \"YufFE style\" is done with one Pylon and three \"big\" buildings. \"FFE style\" needs two Pylons and four big buildings.\n\nOn Maps with \"inbase\" (aka \"backdoor\") or \"pocket natural expansions\" like\n\n- Dusk Towers\n\n- Orbital Shipyard\n\n- Alterzim Stronghold\n\nyou should use a Pro-Wall instead of a Noob-Wall, since a Pylon is vulnerable to Bane Busts.

{"document": "# Reaper (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Protoss\n\n- There exists a timing against Sentry-before-Stalker openings, using a Reaper to distract or even kill the first Sentry and attack with mass Marines; Sentry openings against Terran are not common unfortunately. Proxy-Marauder Bunker-rush is quite common against Protoss instead.\n\n- The commonly used Marines (to 2) or Reaper (1) > Reactor opening is a common opening against Protoss, so the Reaper can intercept the Zealot (1) + Stalker (1) pressure timing, made famous by MC (Has been known to kill Terrans, if the Wall-Off is not complete in time) and buy time the follow-up Reactor to finish. This opening is designed to get a Reactor quickly to deal with proxy-Oracle builds by getting to six Marines (5 cannot kill an Oracle) and get an Engineering Bay up quickly as well.\n\n- Reapers make an excellent scouting alternative to scanning.\n\n- In small battles Reapers are very efficient versus Stalkers, due to their ability to negate damage taken. Three Reapers can beat a single Stalker without losing any Reaper. Four Reapers are able to beat two Stalkers with losing none or only a single Reaper, with minimal micro. A single Reaper is not able to beat a single Sentry, two or more are required.", "question": "How many Reapers are required to defeat two Stalkers with minimal micro and lose no more than one Reaper?", "options": ["1", "2", "3", "4"], "answer": "4"}
{"document": "# Griffith 4\n## Overview\n### Goal\n\nIn early game, the goal is to apply significant pressure with the 2 Rax opening. In the early mid-game (7-9) minutes, the goal is to stay alive while you prepare your OCs. In mid-game, using your economic advantage, the goal is to once again continuously pressure Zerg while aggressively expanding yourself.\n\nPros:\n\n- Provides an extremely strong solid economic foundation for mid-game (around 2200-2500  Minerals: income off 2 bases by 11 minutes).\n\n- Versatile build with countless transitions (has equal if not more versatility than BW's 1 Rax FE), fairly safe against contingency events and cheese methods.\n\n- Forces Zerg to be the aggressor between 7 to 10 minutes, else the mid-game pressure is extremely scary.\n\n- Easily shuts down Mutalisk harass due to your high Marine count and turret mineral sink.\n\n- Can be fairly difficult to scout given the large number of roaming Marines in your base to deny Overlord vision.\n\n- Delays unit composition and tech in exchange for economy. This is an advantage in TvZ because Zerg is a reactive race. The earlier Terran decides on a unit composition, the easier it is countered by Zerg. By delaying Tech, you essentially force Zerg to make the first commitment (to Mutalisks, Infestors, or Roaches).\n\nCons:\n\n- Defending against 2 Hatch Eco Sling/Bling requires advanced simcity skills.\n\n- Requires strong simultaneous macro and micro ability (ex: being able to split attack aggressively while keeping up production, expansions, etc.)\n\n- Requires very good bio micro. Being able to split Marines comfortably is a MUST.\n\n- Requires precise scouting information to determine when and if to put up the 4th OC.\n\n- Main gets mined out quickly and requires aggressive mid-game expansions.", "question": "What is a key advantage of the 2 Rax opening in the early game of StarCraft II?", "options": ["It allows for immediate teching into advanced units", "It provides a strong economic foundation for mid-game", "It focuses on early game harassment with Zerglings", "It encourages early expansion to three bases"], "answer": "It provides a strong economic foundation for mid-game"}
{"document": "# General ZvP Strategy\n## Unit Roles and Counters\n\n- Zerglings: Strong in large numbers against Stalkers and Immortals. Weaker against Zealots, and particularly weak against Colossi.  Because Protoss armies tend to be strongest when clustered together, Zerglings can be used for effective harassment and maintaining map control well into the late game.  Constantly putting a Protoss player on the defense allows safe droning and expanding.\n\n- Roaches: Strong against Zealots and good at breaking defenses.  They are the core of the Zerg army, although they are very vulnerable to force fields and large numbers of colossi.\n\n- Banelings: Useful against Zealots, Probes, and Pylons. Note that Zealots are hardier than other tier 1 light units, making Banelings slightly less effective.  Banelings are most effective when placed into Overlords and used as Baneling bombs.\n\n- Hydralisks: Strong against all units except High Templar and Colossi. Expand creep aggressively to help Hydralisks move faster around the map.  Hydras are extremely effective against Gateway and Stargate units, but lose effectiveness in the mid to late game.  Hydras are typically used defensively against early Void Ray or Phoenix usage.\n\n- Mutalisks: Useful for harass, but easily brought down by very mobile Stalkers, especially once Blink is researched. Stalker armor and Sentry Guardian Shield severely reduce Mutalisk damage.\n\n- Infestors: Useful unit all around. Note that Fungal Growth prevents Stalker Blink and when cast over cloaked units, reveals them.  Infestors are becoming the core of the midgame ZvP match-up.  Fungal growth is extremely effective against Gateway-heavy armies, can be used for mineral line harassment, and can be used to shut down Phoenix/Void Ray harassment.  Mind control can neutralize higher tier Protoss units.\n\n- Corruptors: Hard counter to Colossi, but taken down easily by Stalkers and Void Rays.  Corruptors are not as effective a counter against Colossus as Vikings, but are still a viable option because they can be morphed into Brood Lords.  Corruptors can be used defensively to hold off Colossus timing attacks when a Protoss player will have 3-4 Colossus and the range upgrade.\n\n- Brood Lords: Strong against all ground units except for Blink-Stalkers which will Blink past Broodlings to attack the Brood Lords directly. No defense against Phoenixes and Void Rays.  Brood Lords are most effective if supported by Roaches and Infestors.\n\n- Ultralisks: Can break through Force Fields and wreak havoc among ground units. Obtain armor upgrades to increase survivability.", "question": "Which Zerg unit is particularly effective against Colossi and can be morphed into Brood Lords?", "options": ["Mutalisks", "Hydralisks", "Corruptors", "Ultralisks"], "answer": "Corruptors"}

{"document": "# Ultralisk (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### General\n\nUltralisks, because of their 1 range, fare very well when paired with Zerglings or, in some cases, Broodlings. The Ultralisk's 1 range allows it to attack even when Zerglings or Broodlings are in front of the Ultralisk. Zerglings, Ultralisks, Banelings, and Infestors are often used together as masses of Zerglings or Fungal Growth can trap small armies easily so the Banelings and Ultralisks can deal with them easily. Also, Zerglings, Banelings, and Ultralisks benefit from Melee Attack Upgrades while Infestors don't need attack upgrades.\n\nWith Attack-Move taking priority over the regular Move command, it is recommended to control Ultralisks in a separate group from Zerglings and steer the latter \"manually\" for a brief period - preferably surrounding the opponent's army - until (most of) the Ultralisks have shouldered through the Zerglings and gotten in range of their targets.", "question": "Why is it recommended to control Ultralisks in a separate group from Zerglings during an attack?", "options": ["Because Ultralisks need to be upgraded separately from Zerglings.", "Because Zerglings are faster and can outrun Ultralisks.", "Because Attack-Move takes priority over Move, allowing Ultralisks to get in range of their targets.", "Because Ultralisks require a different micro-management strategy to avoid damage."], "answer": "Because Attack-Move takes priority over Move, allowing Ultralisks to get in range of their targets."}

{"document": "# Battlecruiser (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Usage\n### Vs. Zerg\n\nThe Battlecruiser has some place in TvZ matchup. Rushing to build some Battlecruiser on the battlefield can sometimes force an opponent to deploy more static defense or anti-air unit to counter the mighty ship. The first Battlecruiser can be used as workers harassment thanks to Tactical Jump, an ability to fire on the move and able to fight a handful of unupgraded Hydralisks. Depending on situation, the player may need to switch tech back to factory-based army or deploy more air units to assist the Battlecruiser.\n\nTransitioning to an air-based composition still takes a significant amount of time and resources, which can be done safely in TvT due to the defensive strength and efficiency of Siege Tanks against Terran units. However, in TvZ, the Zerg player has a large window of time to end the game before a full sky fleet can be created.\n\nIn late game, Battlecruiser can become a potent unit to soak up most damage and secure a quick kill on large target using Yamato Cannon. They are weak against the Zerg Corruptor upfront due to their weak air to air (ATA) weapons and slow speed. Many players offset this by using the Raven's Anti-Armor Missile on Corruptor groups. A group of Infestors can stop Battlecruisers from escape via Tactical Jump with Fungal Growth. Neural Parasite is the direct counter to Battlecruiser since they are high-cost units, losing them will likely to spend most resource and time to rebuild a full army.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Zerg\n## Creep Spread\n\nCreep spreading in ZvZ is tricky. Spread too much and you might help your opponent more than yourself, not enough and your defense will be too slow. It's usually not a good idea to sacrifice a larva inject from your Queen for a Creep Tumor, unless you have an abundance of larva or little money. Usually you plant your first Creep Tumor either with your second Queen (if you have gone for an early gas), or around the time you are teching to Lair and taking your third. We categorize creep spread as follows:\n\n- In ALL situations spread creep from your natural to your third, then fourth. This helps you quickly reposition your units between bases and your units will move faster than your opponents, assuming you didn't creep too far.\n\n- If you are going for a Mutalisk opener, do not spread creep beyond connecting your natural to your third until after your initial harassment. Many players that go for a Mutalisk play end up dying to an all-in from their opponent - spreading creep in this situation only helps your opponent get to you sooner.\n\n- If you are going for a Roach opener of any kind, spread as much creep as possible. The extra speed will help but the extra vision will be essential.", "question": "In StarCraft II, when using a Roach opener, how should you manage your creep spread?", "options": ["Avoid spreading creep to prevent your opponent from moving faster.", "Only spread creep from your natural to your third base.", "Spread as much creep as possible to enhance vision and unit speed.", "Do not spread any creep until after your initial harassment."], "answer": "Spread as much creep as possible to enhance vision and unit speed."}
{"document": "# 7 Gate Immortal All-In (vs. Zerg)\n## Execution\n\n- Push when you have your third Immortal and close your wall behind you.\n\n- While you're pushing, you should have a Probe on the map building proxy Pylons as close as possible to your opponent's third base. It's preferable to use Pylons to warp-in reinforcements as the Warp Prism is required for micro purposes.\n\n- Always try to fight in small chokes near some kind of natural wall to avoid being surrounded and to minimize the amount of Force Fields that you need to create a full wall.\n\n- If your opponent builds a high number of Zerglings then you should respond by warping-in Zealots. If they build a high number of Roaches, you will need more Stalkers. If you run out of Force Fields, you will need more Sentries.\n\n- Place your Force Fields to avoid fighting against your opponent's whole army and to prevent being attacked from multiple sides.\n\n- If your Immortals are targeted and low on hit-points, or if your Sentries are surrounded and low on hit-points, use your Warp Prism to save them. When loading up Immortals, quickly unload the Warp Prism in a safer area so that you don't lose out on their DPS for too long.\n\n- Be careful not to let your Warp Prism get sniped by Zerg anti-air (usually Queens, rarely Hydralisks or Mutalisks).\n\n- If you can get close enough to the Zerg player's third base (or any other non-defensive structure) then you should treat it as a large, natural Force Field.\n\n- If the Zerg chooses to avoid your army and instead goes for the base trade, it can be incredibly difficult to defend your natural expansion. It is instead easier to move all your Probes into your main base. Four Sentries will allow you to produce constant Force Fields that will prevent the Zerg player from getting up the ramp whilst you destroy their third base and natural expansion with your main army. Once you have done so, come back home and re-take your natural expansion. You should have dealt enough damage to be ahead. Once the game stabilises, use your Observer to scout what the Zerg is going to try to do to get back into the game; research Blink and get High Templar if they are going for Mutalisks and get Colossi if they are going for Infestors.", "question": "When facing a high number of Roaches from the Zerg, what unit should you warp-in to counter them effectively?", "options": ["Zealots", "Immortals", "Stalkers", "Sentries"], "answer": "Stalkers"}
{"document": "# 10 Pool\n\n10 Pool\nStrategy Information\nMatchups:All\nType:Opening\n\n## Overview\n\nThe 10 Pool is a mixture between an aggressive 6 or 8 pool and an economy safe 13 Pool, and it can be compared to a Brood War 9 Pool. The goal of the strategy is much the same as an 8 Pool but it is a bit safer and less all-in. The Zerg is able to start aggressively without a big economy disadvantage. Can be followed up by a Fast Expand if you did not opt for a Queen.\n\n### Goal\n\nThe goal of a 10 Pool is to harass or even kill the opponent before he is prepared for an early rush.

If the Zerg get fast Queen try to focus the Queen since she stands no chance against the Zerglings. The build also provides an edge over a Protoss with a Fast Core if they lack the necessary Zealot count to catch the Zerglings.

{"document": "# Warp Gate (Legacy of the Void)\n## Competitive Use\n\nThe ability to almost instantaneously produce units at specific locations on the map is a very potent capability for the Protoss, a capability utilized in almost all competitive games.\n\nRather than waiting for the unit to complete at the back end of the production cycle, Warp Gate allows the player to get the unit a short time after paying. Furthermore, Warp Gates are able to warp in units immediately once the seven-second conversion from a Gateway is complete (the cooldown timer is not activated). This means that not only is there no time penalty to switch to Warp Gate, but production is pushed ahead the 30–40 seconds that a unit would otherwise spend in the queue. The vast reduction in queue time, combined with the ability to deploy anywhere in Pylon or Warp Prism power, is a major bonus that makes Warp Gate research essential for every match-up.\n\nThe length of the Warp Gate cooldown period is, in all cases except Sentry, seven seconds shorter (three seconds for a Sentry) than the length of time required to produce the same unit at a conventional Gateway. This amounts to approximately a 15-35% increase in overall production compared to the Gateway, allowing maximum production with fewer Warp Gates. The saved money causes Warp Gate research to practically pay for itself.\n\nIt is useful to note that during the warp-in process, the unit warping in is vulnerable in two ways. First, enemy forces can directly attack the warping-in unit, suffering normal damage. During the warp-in period, the unit being created gradually gains health and shields, but if attacked before it is fully constructed, it will have less health and/or shields when it enters the battle. Another vulnerability is the loss of the Psionic Matrix during warp-in. If the Pylon or Warp Prism providing the power field is destroyed (or if the Warp Prism goes out of phasing mode) while a unit is warping in to that power field, then the unit warping in is instantly destroyed. The unit mineral and vespene costs are fully refunded to the player's resource pool, and the Warp Gate cooldown is reset. This can cause a disruption to the production cycles, but only a brief one if the player is attentive and immediately warps in to a safer location.", "question": "What is the cooldown period for a Warp Gate when warping in a Sentry compared to other units?", "options": ["The same as other units", "Seven seconds longer", "Three seconds shorter", "Seven seconds shorter"], "answer": "Three seconds shorter"}
{"document": "# Bombing\n\n Bombing\nTechnique Information\nCreator(s):Stalife\nMatchups:All\nType:Tactic\n\nBombing is used to refer to the maneuver in which drops or other techniques are used to position units, especially units that deal heavy burst damage (Banelings or even Thors), in the mass of enemy units or structures. This is especially useful in cases where the transporting unit is faster (Thors in Medivacs) or have better ability to survive attacks (Banelings in Overlords). The key to the effectiveness of this technique is the ability of air-borne transports to bypass enemy units and terrain.\n\nIn the use of drops, especially in combat scenarios, bombing may also refer to unit bombing, a specialised use of this technique in which specialised units are transported to block off incoming damage, as Marauders from Baneling attacks.\n\n## Terran\n\n- Hellions or Thors are units that can deal heavy damage with the aid of the mobility of Medivacs, especially in the early game. Marine and Marauder drops may also be considered bombing.\n\n- Marauder or MULE Bombs are the use of drops (Medivac or MULE) to block off incoming attacking units, largely slow Baneling pushes in the early game. There is generally nothing a Zerg fielding Banelings can do against this. However, the cost of Orbital Command energy means that players must heavily consider the loss of mining, scans or supply drops before using MULE Bombs. When Marauders are used against Banelings, the drops may be called Stalife Drops after the forum poster who detailed its use. This is especially effective as Armored units like Marauders take reduced Baneling damage (20), allowing them to take 6 hits. If the Banelings are on attack-move and stop they will attack the Marauders and may explode out of range of the main Terran army. Large Marauders can also easily form a total wall-in.\nTLO used Marauder Bombs very effectively in his second match against LosirA in the first GSL in the Round of 64.\n\n- TLO used Marauder Bombs very effectively in his second match against LosirA in the first GSL in the Round of 64.\n\n- Similar tactics can be used to break Siege Tank lines in TvT. By dropping units on tanks, you can force other tanks to splash each other and break siege lines. If they survive, they can be used to clean up tanks afterwards.\n\n## Zerg\n\n- Zerg bombing is usually based around dropping Banelings onto opposing armies or worker lines to instantly deal heavy splash damage to lower health units. For example, Baneling drops onto an approaching Terran Bio Ball can take out large numbers of Marines and force Terran to retreat. Other units may be used for Zerg, but Banelings instantly trade for cost in ways that are usually respectable.\n\n- It is also possible to bomb by spawning Infested Terrans in your opposing Banelings or in a Bio Ball with tank support to soak up damage and cause the Tanks to deal splash damage to the Marines and Marauders.\n\n## Protoss\n\n- Using Warp Prisms to bomb Terrans with tank friendly fire or Zerg Banelings with armored units can be a moderately good battle tactic, although rarely used as it is not usually cost effective or necessary with Blink, and Warp Prisms and Banelings are not common in Protoss matchups.\n\n- As always, transports may be used to reposition the army in PvP, where drops of Zealots or High Templar into mineral lines (Storm Drops) can be very effective.", "question": "In StarCraft II, what is the primary purpose of using Marauder Bombs in the early game against Zerg Baneling pushes?", "options": ["To increase the speed of the Marauders", "To block off incoming Baneling attacks", "To distract the Zerg player", "To scout enemy base positions"], "answer": "To block off incoming Baneling attacks"}

Economic, yet flexible and safe.\n\nAs there's not much opportunity for aggression as long as the Protoss sticks to 2base on this map, focus on getting a strong economy yourself to maximize unit production later on. Once Protoss pulls up his 3rd base, you have to be in a position to do some damage, or you'll have a hard time sticking in the game. Unlike the natural, the 3rd base has multiple attack routes and has quite some distance between the main by ground. This allows you to split up the Protoss army and force him to engage in areas more open and beneficial to the Zerg army. The green area is the only place around the Protoss base you'll typically want to have a large engagement at, the red are there to split up the army and engage in small skirmishes.\n\nBecause blink Stalkers do very well fending off Roaches, Hydralisks and Zerglings by blinking up and down the edges of the bases, it's a good idea to mix in some Infestors when you attack. Alternatively, Baneling drops are a great complement to your army when facing Stalker groups.", "question": "When facing a Protoss player on the Antiga Shipyard map, what is a recommended strategy to counter blink Stalkers?", "options": ["Avoid attacking altogether and focus on defending.", "Mix in some Infestors with your main army.", "Build more Roaches to overwhelm the Stalkers.", "Construct additional Spine Crawlers near your base."], "answer": "Mix in some Infestors with your main army."}

An Infested Terran has 50 health, lives for 21 seconds and has a ranged attack.\n\nInfested Terran is a versatile spell that is excellent for harassment. Since Infestors can use this spell while Burrowed, they can sneak behind enemy mineral lines and cast this spell to disrupt the enemy's economy (especially when used with Fungal Growth), or destroy key buildings without sacrificing portions of their main army. Infestors can be paired with ground-attacking only units (such as the Ultralisk/Zergling) and spawn the Infested Terrans to deal with air units. Infested Terrans are disposable (they cost nothing to create and automatically expire after twenty-one seconds) and, as such, can be spawned as the front line to tank damage while the main army is behind, semi-protected by the Infested Terrans. For example, spawning Infested Terrans on top of Siege Tanks is an excellent way to gain ground while causing the tanks to inflict friendly fire. They are also easy to replenish with numerous Infestors; an infestor gains 25 energy in approximately 31.7 seconds, meaning that a Zerg player can spawn approximately two Infested Terrans per minute per Infestor that he has in his army. Coupled with an Overlord, an Infestor can spawn Infested Terrans across different levels of terrain for harassment. By using the rapid fire method, Zerg users can choose to drop Infested Terrans one-by-one or in a single, massive clump.

{"document": "# Glon's Guide to Zerg vs. Zerg\n## Mid Game\n\nPlaying in the mid game in ZvZ is all about reacting to what your opponent does. Therefore, this section will be split up into several sections:\n\n- Versus a Mutalisk player (if you are not going for Mutalisks), your goal should be to establish a third base and get Infestors onto the field. Typically, as soon as the Infestor player scouts the Spire, they will place two Spores at their third, one at their main and natural, and another between their natural and third. Keep in mind that after getting 5-6 Infestors, the Infestor player must wait until they also get up Hydralisks in order to push out across the maps (since Mutalisks can split up to avoid being Fungaled en mass), so remember not to push out across the map too early. In the mean time, prepare to defend yourself against Zergling/Mutalisk harass.\n\n- In a Mutalisk versus Mutalisk situation, frame your strategy around harassment and timings. To begin, immediately once your Spire is done start +1 armor. Take Mutalisk engagements right after any upgrade finishes - An upgrade advantage in Mutalisk versus Mutalisk fights makes or breaks the engagement. The upgrade progression for your Spire should be: +1 armor into +1 attack into +2 armor. The reason you get +1 attack before +2 armor is because of the drastically lower cost and lower production time. Remember to harass your opponent's bases with your Mutalisks - typically a player should attack with Zerglings at one base while moving in with Mutalisks at a base on the opposite side of the map in order to tax your opponent's multitasking ability as much as possible.\n\n- To defend all-ins, scouting is key. If you see your opponent saving up a lot of Larva, you are being all-inned. Also keep in mind the 8:30 timing: when a player can save up a large amount of Roaches to suddenly move out across the map and surprise you. The best way to scout for these timings is to simply be active with units - if you are poking at your opponent's natural with Zerglings, he will be forced to partially reveal his hand in order to defend. Do remember, however, that ZvZ is a volatile match-up and that sometimes, build orders will just counter others and there isn't much you can do about it.\n\n- Extra Tip: Due to Infested Terrans being nerfed heavily (along with Infestors), we suggest going for five or six Infestors then transitioning to Hydralisks. Having a solid Hydralisk base in your army will allow you to push positions that you otherwise couldn't with mass Infestor/Roach.", "question": "What is the recommended upgrade progression for your Spire in a Mutalisk versus Mutalisk situation?", "options": ["+1 attack into +1 armor into +2 attack", "+1 armor into +1 attack into +2 armor", "+2 armor into +1 attack into +1 armor", "+1 attack into +2 armor into +1 armor"], "answer": "+1 armor into +1 attack into +2 armor"}
